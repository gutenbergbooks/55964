<span class="small">THE HOUSE IN CHARLTON STREET</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was five o'clock and a very dull, dark afternoon
in Charlton Street. One by one
lights had twinkled out in all the little two-story-and-dormer-windowed
houses on the
block,&mdash;in all but one. The parlor windows of
this house were still unlit, but behind the
flower-box in one of them a hand could be seen
moving aside the white curtains at frequent
intervals and a dim face peering anxiously into
the dusk.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past five precisely, two trim
girl-figures turned the corner of Varick Street,
hurried down the block, raced up the steps of
this same house, and waved frantically at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
dark windows. An answering wave saluted
them from between the parted curtains. At
the same moment lights twinkled out from the
windows, and a quick hand pulled down the
shades with a jerk, shutting out the dim street
for the night. But back of the drawn shades
a small figure in an invalid-chair held out welcoming
arms to the girls who had just entered.</p>

<p>"My! How long you were! I thought
you'd never get here to-day. And it's been
so dark and dismal all the afternoon, too!"
The two girls, who were plainly twins, knelt
down, one on each side of the invalid-chair.</p>

<p>"We <i>were</i> an age, I know, Margaret dear,"
began Bess, "but there was a good reason.
It's quite exciting,&mdash;all about the new girl!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can never guess what, either!"
echoed Jess, winding one of Margaret's dark
curls around her finger.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me&mdash;quick!" The child's big,
beautiful gray eyes fairly sparkled with eagerness,
and a faint flush tinted her delicate face.
"Is it that queer girl you told me about, who
only came into the class a few days ago?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the one,&mdash;but let's get our things
off first and see if Sarah made any cookies to-day.
We're starving!"</p>

<p>A huge woman who had been moving about
the room lighting gas-jets, pulling down
shades, and straightening the furniture, now
broke into the conversation: "Ye kin save
yerselves the trouble! I ain't made no cookies
this day&mdash;an' me wid all that wash! What d'
ye think I be?"</p>

<p>"Go 'long, Sarah!" laughed Bess. "You
know there's probably a whole jarful in the
pantry, and we don't care whether you made
them to-day or a week ago. They're always
dandy!"</p>

<p>Sarah gave a chuckle that shook her huge
frame, and tucked a light shawl lovingly about
the knees of the girl in the chair.</p>

<p>"Ye'll have a hard time findin' any!" she
warned, as the two ran off. "Won't they,
Margie, macushla?"</p>

<p>In five minutes the twins were back, each
with a massive chunk of chocolate layer-cake
in her hand and a mouth full of the same.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>"You told the truth, Sarah, for once!
There weren't any cookies, but this is heaps
better!"</p>

<p>"If ye get any crumbs on me floor," threatened
Sarah, ominously, "ye'll have no more
cake of any kind, the week out!" And she departed
downstairs in great (pretended) displeasure.</p>

<p>"Now for it! Tell me right away," demanded
Margaret. "I'm <i>so</i> impatient to
hear!"</p>

<p>"Well," began Bess, in muffled tones, struggling
to swallow a large mouthful of cake, "you
remember we told you about that nice girl who
came into our section three days ago, but who
seemed so offish and queer and quiet. She's
always staring out of the window, as if she were
dreaming. And when she isn't studying,
she's reading some book the whole time. And
she hardly ever talks to a soul. Jess and I
thought she must feel rather lonesome and
strange. You know it is rather hard to come
into the first year of High School more than a
month after everything's started, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
one else has got acquainted, and try to pick
up! I think one must feel so awfully out of it!</p>

<p>"So Jess and I decided we'd ask her to eat
lunch with us to-day. She always eats by herself,
and yesterday she didn't eat at all,&mdash;just
read a book the whole time! I went up to her
at lunch-period and said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's her name?" interrupted Margaret.</p>

<p>"Corinne Cameron,&mdash;isn't it a dandy name?
Corinne! It has such a <i>distinguished</i> sound!&mdash;Well,
she was reading, as usual, and looked up
at me sort of dazed and far-away when I asked
her if she'd care to eat with us. But she
seemed very glad to do it and came right over.
We had a very interesting talk, and she asked
us right away to call her 'Corinne,' instead of
'Miss Cameron,' as they do in High School.
She said it made her feel about a hundred miles
away from every one to be called 'Miss.' So
of course we asked her to call us 'Elisabeth'
and 'Jessica.'"</p>

<p>"But why didn't you tell her just 'Bess'
and 'Jess'?" interrupted Margaret again.
"That's so much more natural."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you see, 'Corinne' sounds so sort of
distinguished and&mdash;and dignified! And somehow
our names don't. They just seem ordinary
and&mdash;and so like small children. And at
least 'Elisabeth' and 'Jessica' seem more&mdash;grown-up!"</p>

<p>"What does she look like?" questioned Margaret,
going off on another tack.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's, well, sort of distinguished-looking,
too&mdash;like her name. She's tall and slim
and has very dark brown wavy hair, and big,
dark eyes, almost black, and the prettiest
straight nose,&mdash;not a little <i>snub</i> like ours (I
don't mean yours, Margaret! <i>That's</i> all
right!). But she always acts as though her
thoughts were about a thousand miles away.
She talked about books mostly, and asked us
if we didn't just <i>love</i> to read. And when we
said no, not so awfully, she seemed so astonished.
I said we'd rather play basket-ball,
and she laughed and said we couldn't play that
<i>all</i> the time, and what did we do with our spare
moments. I told her we didn't have many, because,
at home here, we were always busy amusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
you or helping Sarah, when we weren't
studying.</p>

<p>"Then she asked about you, Margaret, and
was <i>so</i> interested when we told her about your
poor back, and how you couldn't move around
much or go to school, but studied with us and
knew just as much as we did&mdash;and <i>more</i>, because
you read a great deal, too, even though
you are only thirteen and we're fifteen. And
she said:</p>

<p>"'That's perfectly fine!' Well, we were
talking so hard that we scarcely noticed lunch-period
was over, and we hadn't said half that
we wanted to. She promised to eat with us
every day.</p>

<p>"This afternoon we decided not to stay for
basket-ball in the gym, because Jess's finger
hurts so much where she cut it last night. So
we left at half-past two (which we hardly ever
do), and who should start to walk over our way
but Corinne, and she was delighted that we
could go part of the way together. She lives
in the Ten Eyck, that swell new apartment in
West Twelfth Street."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"The Ten Eyck!" exclaimed Margaret, in a
tone of hushed awe. "Gracious! she must be
very wealthy, then!"</p>

<p>"Wait till you hear!" murmured Jess, parenthetically,
and Bess went on:</p>

<p>"She told us they'd just moved there because
her father, who isn't in very good health,
has to live near his business. He's in a big
steamship company on West Street. And
until now they've always lived in an apartment
on Madison Avenue near Central Park. They
just moved down here a week ago. Her
mother is dead, and an aunt, her father's sister,
lives with them.</p>

<p>"By this time we had reached the Ten Eyck,
and what do you think!&mdash;she asked us to come
in and chat awhile, because she was all alone.
Her aunt was out at some club. Of course we
went in, and my! but it was splendiferous, especially
going up to the eighth floor in a big elevator!
Their rooms are sort of built all
around a central hall. It's different from any
apartment we were ever in. Corinne took us
to her room, which was about as large as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
parlor, and had the cutest low bookcases all
around the walls and lovely cushioned seats in
the windows. And we sat there and talked a
long time.</p>

<p>"But here's another queer thing about her.
While we were talking about school and our
studies, and how hard the geometry seemed, she
suddenly showed us an old book that was lying
on her table,&mdash;it was a <i>very</i> old, battered-up
looking book with brown stains on the leaves,
and one cover half hanging off, and the queerest
old-fashioned pictures,&mdash;and, she asked us
whether we'd like to look at it. She said it
was her chief treasure just now. It was called
'Valentine's Manual, Volume II,' and seemed
to be all about New York City in very early
times. She said her father had picked it up at
an auction-sale of some one's library, and had
given it to her for her birthday.</p>

<p>"I didn't say much, for somehow I thought
it was an awfully queer thing to get for your
birthday&mdash;an old, dilapidated, uninteresting
book like that! And then I guess she saw
that we were surprised, for she said:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>"'Don't you love <i>old</i> things?'</p>

<p>"I just had to laugh,&mdash;it all seemed so queer!
And I said, no, I preferred them brand-new.
And then she said:</p>

<p>"'Well, perhaps every one doesn't feel the
same as I do; for Father says I'm a born antiquarian,
just as he is!' We couldn't say a
word, either of us, for actually, we don't know
what 'antiquarian' means! She went out of
the room just after that and brought back some
lemonade and little sweet crackers. Then we
had to leave, for it was getting late, and we
knew you'd be watching for us." Here Bess
ended her recital and Margaret instantly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Get the dictionary&mdash;quick! I want to see
what 'antiquarian' means!"</p>

<p>"That's just like you!" commented Jess, as
she hauled a big Webster's Unabridged out of
the bookcase. "You're a lot like Corinne, too.
I think you two would get on beautifully together.
Here it is:</p>

<p>"'Antiquarian,&mdash;one who is addicted to the
study of antiquities; an admirer of antiquity.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
And 'antiquities' are old things, of course.
Well, what she sees to admire in 'em beats me!
Anyhow, she's an awfully nice girl,&mdash;sort of
unusual, you know,&mdash;and I'm glad we made
her acquaintance. Bess and I were saying on
the way home that it's kind of like an <i>adventure</i>
to meet unusual people&mdash;" Jess broke
off suddenly, at the sound of a latch-key in the
front door, and they all exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There's Mother! Isn't she early to-night!"</p>

<p>A pleasant-voiced woman called out to them
cheerily, and a moment later entered the room.
Mrs. Bronson's face, which singularly resembled
her youngest daughter's, had once been
very pretty, but now showed many traces of
anxious care. Her expression was of one who
was constantly thinking over worrisome matters.
But at the sight of the trio her face lit
up, the lines smoothed away temporarily, and
ten years seemed magically to drop from her
as she sat down in the group, questioning them
about the affairs of their day.</p>

<p>After a few moments the twins went off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
downstairs to help Sarah with the dinner, and
Margaret was left to her coveted half-hour
alone with her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mummy," she sighed, snuggling her
head on Mrs. Bronson's shoulder, "this is
lovely! You don't often get home so early.
But I appreciate it specially, because I feel
sort of blue and no-'count to-night."</p>

<p>"Is that so, dear?" exclaimed her mother,
some of the anxious lines returning to her face.
"Is the pain worse? What has happened to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't my back," Margaret almost
sobbed. "It's just that <i>nothing</i> has happened&mdash;to
me&mdash;to-day; nothing ever <i>does</i> happen!
I just sit here all day long, waiting for 'something
to turn up,' like Dickens' <i>Mr. Micawber</i>,
and nothing ever does turn up! The twins go
out and meet nice people and have pleasant
things happen, but there's nothing like that
for me. Oh, I want some adventures&mdash;just
one nice, big, beautiful adventure would do&mdash;some
delightful, unexpected surprise! I'd be
content if I could have just <i>one</i>!" It was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
unusual for Margaret to make the slightest
complaint, and it was well now that her head
was on her mother's shoulder, and that she did
not see the sudden pain in Mrs. Bronson's face.</p>

<p>"Dearie, I know!" her mother said. "It's
dull enough for you, sitting here day after day.
But we're all doing the best we can to make
you happy. After all, you never can tell
what's going to happen. Just keep on hoping
for something interesting to 'turn up,' and
I'm sure sometime it will. Things occasionally
happen in the most unexpected way!
Even <i>Mr. Micawber</i> had something pleasant
'turn up' after a while, if you remember."</p>

<p>Margaret snuggled her head closer.
"You're a <i>dear</i>, Mummy! You do cheer me
up so! I feel better already, and I'm going
to hope harder than ever that something nice
and interesting&mdash;some real <i>adventure</i>&mdash;will
turn up sometime, perhaps <i>soon</i>!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="small">SOMETHING TURNS UP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">And</span> the unexpected happened sooner,
much sooner, than Margaret would even
have dared to dream. Something did "turn
up"! But like many adventures, it came
clothed in the guise of quite an ordinary, every
day affair, and there was little about its beginning
to suggest the remotest idea of anything
startling. To be exact, it was simply that
about a week after the beginning of their acquaintance
the twins came home one day with
the announcement that their new friend, Corinne,
had expressed a decided wish to call and
make Margaret's acquaintance, and that they
had invited her for the following day. At first
Margaret had protested strongly:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, girls! I can't see her. You know
I never see any strangers. It's awfully nice
of her. But&mdash;but I wouldn't know what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
say to any one I didn't know very well. Do
thank her for me, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Bess, decidedly. "It'll
do you good to see some one beside just ourselves.
Mother thinks so too. And you'll
<i>like</i> her, I know. I couldn't tell her she
mustn't come, anyway! It wouldn't be polite!"
And that clinched the argument.</p>

<p>In reality, it had seemed quite wonderful to
Margaret that this interesting new friend of
her sisters could possibly care to become acquainted
with her, and she felt grateful for the
pleasant attention. But with the unconquerable
shyness of a secluded invalid she shrank
from the meeting, all her longing for something
new and exciting to happen being temporarily
forgotten. And then the day arrived.</p>

<p>"Ye'll be after havin' company, this afternoon,
Margie mavourneen, so I suppose ye'll
be wantin' a little snack about half-past four?"
Sarah had just wheeled Margaret into the front
parlor by the window, raised the shades a trifle,
and tucked her idol securely and cozily into her
chair.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Sarah! Do have hot chocolate and
those lovely drop-cakes you made this morning!"</p>

<p>"Who's the gur-rl that's comin', anyway?
Shure it's a strange thing for <i>you</i> to be seein'
any one!" Sarah exclaimed jealously as she
turned to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, some one named Corinne Cameron.
She's a nice girl. The twins like her," replied
Margaret, with assumed indifference. Not for
worlds would she have allowed Sarah to read
her real feelings on the subject.</p>

<p>"Huh!" was Sarah's only reply as she
handed Margaret her book and lumbered heavily
downstairs to the kitchen, while the invalid
settled herself to wait for the arrival of her
twin sisters and their "queer" new friend. It
was only two o'clock and she couldn't possibly
expect them before three or a quarter past.
The time loomed long and interminable before
her. First she tried to read, but even the beloved
"Little Women" failed to interest her.
So she rested her elbow on the arm of her chair,
and, chin in hand, stared out of the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
across the street at a squat little dormer-windowed
house directly opposite.</p>

<p>Would she really, she wondered, like the girl
who was coming that day? The occasion was
certainly an unusual one in her uneventful life,
for she saw, as a rule, almost no one outside of
her own family, except the doctor. From the
time she was a small baby she had suffered with
an affection of the spine, and the physicians
could hold out no hope that she would ever be
anything but an invalid. Ever since she had
grown too large to be carried about, she had
spent her waking hours in this invalid-chair.</p>

<p>Of the outside world she saw little save the
view from the parlor windows, and what passed
before her each sunny day during the short
hour that Sarah pushed her in her chair up and
down the block. But Margaret was singularly
loving and sweet-tempered, and most of
the time successfully hid the pain and weariness
she suffered, both in body and mind. Few
realized, except the faithful Sarah, what bodily
misery she often endured; and none could appreciate
the unconquerable shyness that kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
her from all companionship with girls of her
own age, excepting that of her sisters.</p>

<p>Margaret envied nothing more heartily than
the ability to join in the athletic sports of the
robust twins. She yearned above all things to
play basket-ball and wield a tennis-racket.
And because such things were to be forever impossible
to her, she felt that she could be of no
earthly interest to her sisters' equally athletic
comrades, so she shyly refused to meet any of
them. But this new girl was obviously "different."
Margaret felt that perhaps she
would understand, that they would find much
of common interest to talk about. For Margaret,
too, loved books,&mdash;loved them with the
passionate delight that only confirmed invalids
can feel for the printed magic that takes them
out of themselves and makes them forget their
bodily ills. She read voraciously everything
that came her way. Beside that, she had long
ago insisted on studying with the twins. She
kept pace with them through all their school
work and often outstripped them in the quickness
of her comprehension. And the twins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
were immensely proud of her attainments.</p>

<p>The home life of the Bronsons was a pleasant
one, but rather different in many ways from
that of ordinary families. Their father had
died when Margaret was a baby. Their
mother was the busy, worried, overworked director
of a large French dressmaking establishment
on Fifth Avenue. By her earnings she
supported her family in moderate comfort and
maintained the little house in Charlton Street,
which had always been their home. She went
away to business early every morning, and
often did not arrive home till late in the evening,
especially in the "rush" seasons. Thus
she saw little of her children except on Sundays,
and then she was usually too tired to enjoy
their company, though she loved them
devotedly.</p>

<p>It was big, loyal Sarah McKinstry who
really ran and directed the household. She
had lived with the family ever since Mrs. Bronson
had come to the Charlton Street house, a
bride, and considered it her own. Little, frail,
ailing Margaret she adored with a passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
and jealous devotion. Margaret never teased
her, as did the twins, and many a weary night
had she spent sitting up with the little sufferer
when the pain was worse than usual. Her
sharp tongue she used on the others unsparingly,
but never on the delicate child in the
invalid-chair. Nevertheless, as a matter of
fact, she was really devoted to them all. And
though they, perhaps, never expressed it in
quite that way, they knew that the heart of
Sarah McKinstry was as a precious jewel in a
setting of cast-iron.</p>

<p>So on this sunny afternoon sat Margaret in
her window, wondering much about the coming
visit,&mdash;wondering for the hundredth time
if she would really like this queer Corinne
Cameron, and&mdash;which was even more important&mdash;would
she be liked in return.</p>

<p>The clock on the mantel chimed three, and
Margaret began to crane her neck in order to
see as far down the street as possible. They
would come from the Varick Street end of the
block, she knew, because they always walked
down that way, in preference to the shorter but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
not so pleasant route through Macdougal
Street.</p>

<p>At three-fifteen precisely they swung into
view. The twins, who looked very much alike,
were walking one on each side of a tall girl, who
topped them by almost a head. Margaret
gave a little gasp and leaned far out of her
chair. In one swift glance she scanned the
new acquaintance, as the three came abreast of
the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going to like her&mdash;<i>surely</i>!" she
whispered, as she waved in answer to the triple
salute. Then she drew back suddenly behind
the curtains in a new access of shyness, now
that the encounter was really so close.</p>

<p>But if Margaret had any lingering doubts on
the subject, they were quickly dispelled in the
first half-hour with the "queer" girl. Corinne
broke the ice at once after her introduction to
the little invalid.</p>

<p>"What a dear, fascinating house you live
in!" she began, gazing about the parlor with
her dreamy, far-away look. "That carved
marble mantel is just fine, and so are the pillars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
between the rooms, and all this white paneling."</p>

<p>The twins stared at each other and then at
Margaret.</p>

<p>"Mercy! Do you think so?" cried Bess.
"Why, we've always thought it the horridest,
old-fashioned place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's just what I mean," interrupted Corinne.
"It <i>is</i> old-fashioned, and that's why
it's so delightful!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we forgot that you like <i>old</i> things!"
laughed Bess. "Well, this is just a little, old,
shabby rookery, and not a single interesting
thing about it. You don't know how we've
<i>longed</i> to move into a lovely new apartment&mdash;like
the one you live in, for instance,&mdash;and have
all the up-to-date fixings and everything."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd give a <i>lot</i> to change with you!"
replied Corinne. "I <i>hate</i> apartments! I've
lived in one all my life, and I've always just
dreamed of living in a dear old house like this
that was built fifty or a hundred years ago.
Think of all the things that must have happened
in it, and all the history it's seen!&mdash;Nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
ever heard of anything <i>historical</i> about an
apartment-house!"</p>

<p>Margaret, who hadn't said a word all this
time, leaned forward now with shining eyes
and demanded:</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Corinne&mdash;" (she hesitated just a little
over the unaccustomed name) "what can
you possibly see about this place that's interesting?
We've always thought it just as ordinary
as&mdash;as ordinary could be,&mdash;when we've
thought about it at all!" And now Corinne
was in her element.</p>

<p>"Why, think of it!" she exclaimed. "Think
what stories there must be about this house&mdash;or
any old house! Think what strange things
may have happened in it! Think what history
it's seen! Think what mysteries there may be
about it&mdash;if we only knew them! Just imagine
what scenes people may have looked at out of
those darling little dormer-windows, or what
famous generals may have leaned against this
white-pillared mantel and talked of their battles,
or what traitors may have sat in this parlor
and laid plots, or what secret letters may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
hidden behind the woodwork in that funny little
cater-cornered closet over there, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly from sheer lack of
breath. Her three listeners were staring at her
spellbound. Even the less impressionable
twins were devouring her words in wide-eyed
wonder.</p>

<p>As for Margaret, she was tingling to her finger-tips
with a strange excitement. A whole
new vista of wonderful things had suddenly
been opened to her. She looked about on what
she had always considered her perfectly ordinary,
commonplace home, and her very scalp
prickled to think of the many-sided mysteries
its walls might contain. She felt a sudden
wild desire to get to the cater-cornered closet
Corinne had mentioned (though she knew it
contained nothing more exciting than Sarah's
dusters and some dilapidated books), rip out
its white woodwork and search frantically for
hidden documents. Instead, she leaned back
in her chair with a long sigh, and remarked:</p>

<p>"Well, you are a wonder, Corinne! You've
given me something new to think of. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
now on, this house will always be as interesting
to me as a story!"</p>

<p>Corinne nodded, but only said, "I know!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Jess sat up with a start and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, Corinne, as you're so interested
in old things, I wonder if you'd like to see
the spinning-wheel we've got up in the attic.
Mother says it belonged to her grandmother in
New England more than a hundred years
ago!"</p>

<p>"Have you actually an <i>attic</i>?" cried Corinne,
joyfully. "Oh, do let me see it&mdash;that is, if it
won't be inconvenient! Actually, girls, I've
never been in a <i>real</i> attic in my life! And I'd
love to see the spinning-wheel, too."</p>

<p>"Well, come right along with me," said Jess,
"and we'll see it while the daylight lasts. I
suppose it isn't the same kind of an attic you'd
find in a big old farmhouse, but it's the open
space over the top floor that we've always used
as an attic and storeroom, except the back part,
which is finished off into a room that Sarah
uses. She's our maid,&mdash;or rather, our housekeeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and we'd better not let her catch us up
there, because she's awfully particular how she
keeps the attic, and never allows us to go up
and disturb things."</p>

<p>So Jess escorted the antique-loving Corinne
to the exploration of the attic, while Bess remained
downstairs to keep Margaret company.</p>

<p>"Well?" she questioned, turning to her
younger sister as soon as the others were out of
ear-shot. She knew that no further explanation
of her question was necessary.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's simply wonderful!" exclaimed
Margaret, in a half-whisper. "I rather expected
I'd <i>like</i> her, but I never dreamed she'd
be as interesting as this. And she thinks the
same way I do about a lot of things."</p>

<p>"But isn't she <i>queer</i>!" marveled Bess. "Actually,
on the way walking down here this afternoon,
I thought we'd never be able to drag
her past some of the old, rickety places on
Varick Street. She'd stand in front of each
one and rave about it till we really began to
attract the notice of people passing. But she
didn't care! You'd have thought we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
sight-seeing in Europe! And she was worst of
all in front of that ramshackle old place on the
corner of Carmine Street, that has a whole
piece of the side cut off, apparently, and the
front door stuck in that funny angle. True as
you live, she got out a blank-book and pencil
and stood there sketching it! (You know, she
draws beautifully.) Said she wanted to show
it to her father! I didn't think or care anything
about that kind of talk then; but do you
know, what she's said here this afternoon actually
makes me feel kind of interested in it all!
I seem to see a lot in these old things that I
didn't before."</p>

<p>Bess gazed about the parlor again with
speculative eyes, and added: "Now, that old
cupboard in the corner, for instance," when
they were both startled by a loud crash from
upstairs.</p>

<p>"Gracious!&mdash;what was that?" she exclaimed,
and ran out to the foot of the stairs to listen.
But as there were no further alarming noises,
she soon came back.</p>

<p>"I guess it wasn't anything serious, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
hope nothing's broken or disturbed, or
Sarah'll have a fit!"</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Corinne and Jess came
tearing down the stairs, breathless and excited,
the latter carrying something in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that bang?" cried Jess. "It
was an accident&mdash;I'll tell you about it&mdash;but
we made the most wonderful discovery&mdash;you
can never guess what!" she was panting for
breath and stopped short at this point.</p>

<p>"Tell me! Tell me quick!" begged Margaret,
almost wriggling out of her chair in her
excitement.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" Corinne, equally breathless,
took up the tale. "We brought it down&mdash;"
At this moment there came the sound of heavy,
thumping steps on the basement stairs, and
Jess, running to the bookcase, hastily thrust
something far behind a row of books.</p>

<p>"Sarah's coming!" she warned. "I've hid
it. She mustn't guess what we've been up to,
or she'd spoil everything!" She laid a warning
finger on her lips as Sarah tramped massively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
into the parlor bearing a daintily spread
tray.</p>

<p>"I hur-rd a tur-rible bangin' jest now!" she
remarked suspiciously as she set it down.
Then turning her eyes on the twins: "What
might the pair of ye have been up to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, Sarah!" Jess replied sweetly.
"I went up to the attic for a moment, and
something fell while I was pulling it out. But
there wasn't any damage done," she hastened
on reassuringly, "and I put it right back!"</p>

<p>"I've warned ye to keep out of that attic!"
grumbled Sarah, arranging the chocolate-cups.
"Something always happens when ye go there.
From now on, I think I'll be lockin' it up!"</p>

<p>"My gracious!" thought Margaret, boiling
inwardly with impatience. "I <i>do</i> believe this
is an <i>adventure</i>, at last! Will Sarah <i>ever</i> get
out of this room so that I can hear all about it!"</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="small">THE DISCOVERY IN THE ATTIC</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">But</span> Sarah continued to circulate around
the little tea-table, clattering the cups,
pouring the chocolate, and handing about the
napkins and plates. And all the while she was
scanning Margaret's new visitor with jealous
and appraising eyes. Her ministrations
seemed fairly interminable to the impatient
four, and during the whole time that she was
serving the refreshments not one of them uttered
a word. So much of a contrast was this
silence to their usual volubility, that she delivered
this Parthian shot as she was at last taking
her departure:</p>

<p>"Ye all seem mighty quiet, though ye were
chatterin' hard enough when I come up! I'm
thinkin' ye must have guilty consciences!"</p>

<p>When she had disappeared, Corinne spoke
up:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"You girls all seem rather afraid of your
maid, if you'll pardon my remarking it! But
I think she seems very good-hearted."</p>

<p>"Why, it's this way," replied Bess. "You
see, Sarah's more than just a maid or a servant.
She runs the whole house, really, because
Mother's away so much and just trusts
her with everything. She's awfully good to
us children and would do almost anything for
us. But she's very, very particular about her
work and her way of arranging things, and she
won't be interfered with the least bit. Why,
Mother herself wouldn't think of changing
any of Sarah's arrangements, even if she didn't
like them, because Sarah wouldn't stand for
it, and we couldn't do without her. Jess and
I tease her a lot, and she lets us have anything
we want to eat; but we mustn't on any account
interfere with her in other ways, or
there'd be trouble!"</p>

<p>Bess did not enlighten Corinne, however, as
to the real reason for their consideration of
Sarah. It was because of an episode that had
happened when she and her twin sister were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
several years younger. They had rebelled one
fine day at what they considered Sarah's tyranny,
and for twelve long hours had led her a
life of excitement and angry remonstrance.
And then that night, just as their mother arrived
home, behold Sarah descending the
stairs, dressed for departure, a huge carpetbag
in each hand. A stormy and tearful
scene ensued in which Sarah finally relented
at the urgent importunities of the distracted
Mrs. Bronson. But she promised to remain
only on condition that the twins should obey
her implicitly from that moment.</p>

<p>And in the privacy of their bedroom that
night Mrs. Bronson had warned the nine-year-old
rebels that, should such a scene ever occur
again, she would give up their home, put Margaret
in a sanatorium and the twins in the
strictest boarding-school she could find, and
herself find a place to live nearer to her business.
The threat had its lasting effect, and
nothing of the kind had ever happened since.
But this was the true reason why the family
lived in wholesome awe of Sarah. And, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
twins were anything but proud of the episode,
they never referred to it.</p>

<p>"Sarah will probably do just as she threatened,"
added Jess, looking meaningly at
Corinne, "and lock up the attic. She's awfully
particular about that place! You'd
think it was as important as the parlor!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Margaret, who could endure the
suspense no longer, burst out:</p>

<p>"If some one doesn't tell me quick all about
that mysterious thing you found in the attic,
I'll&mdash;I'll go <i>crazy</i>!" Then she dropped back
in her chair, overcome anew by shyness at
having been so vehement before a comparative
stranger.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell her, right away!" cried Corinne.
"I know just how she feels!"</p>

<p>"Well, it happened this way," began Jess,
between a sip of chocolate and a bite of drop-cake.
"Corinne and I were looking at the
spinning-wheel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and it's a beauty, too!" interrupted
Corinne. "You ought to have it down here."</p>

<p>"&mdash;and then we got to poking around, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36&ndash;38</a></span>
into some boxes and talking about the
funny old hooded cradle that Mother brought
from her home in Massachusetts. And all of
a sudden Corinne spied that little old hair-trunk,&mdash;do
you remember it, Bess?&mdash;and she
said she'd never seen an old trunk like that
before. I asked her if she'd like to look into
it. I really didn't remember, myself, what
the inside was like or what was kept in it. She
said she would, so we started to haul it down.
It's rather small, and Sarah had it piled way
up on that high shelf.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we gave it too hard a jerk,
for all of a sudden, down it came&mdash;smash!&mdash;and
flew open (you know it hasn't any lock
now), and everything in it was scattered all
over the floor. Sarah had all our winter
flannels packed away in it, and you can imagine
what a time we had picking them up and
trying to fold and get them back so she
wouldn't know what had happened!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="Corinne" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small">"Corinne noticed that the bottom of the trunk seemed all wrong"</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"But here's the queer part of it! Just after
we'd collected all the things and folded them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
nicely and were going to put them back, Corinne
noticed that the bottom of the trunk
seemed all wrong. One corner of it was
humped up as though it had been knocked
through in falling. I tell you I was scared,
for I thought Sarah'd just go wild when she
found it out! But when we turned the trunk
upside down,&mdash;lo and behold! the bottom of it
was <i>all right</i>&mdash;just as tight as a trivet!</p>

<p>"If we weren't astonished! We just
didn't know what to make of it! Then we
turned it back, and I put my hand under the
part that was poked up, gave it a pull, and&mdash;it
came right out!&mdash;the whole bottom! And
there, if you please, was the <i>real</i> bottom of the
trunk, underneath! But between the two was
lying hidden&mdash;<i>this</i>!" Jess ran to the bookcase,
pulled out the mysterious object she had concealed
there, and crossing the room laid it in
Margaret's lap. They all crowded about the
chair.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Bess, in a tone of great
disappointment, before the others could speak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
"it's only an old, dusty, disreputable account-book
with the back torn off. I don't see anything
so wonderful in that!"</p>

<p>"Wait till you've seen what's inside!" remarked
Corinne, quietly. Margaret, meanwhile,
was fingering the crumbly leather cover,
wondering at its queer, mottled aspect. Then
she opened it to the first page and suddenly
gave a big gasp.</p>

<p>"Well, of all things!" she murmured.
"What in the world can it mean? I never saw
anything like it before!"</p>

<p>"Neither did I!" agreed Bess, now in a tone
of real awe. The other two only smiled, with
a rather "I-told-you-so!" expression. Well
might they marvel over its strange contents.
The pages were yellow with age and mottled
with curious brown stains, and some of them
were torn. But the writing was still visible,
and this is what it looked like:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="Code" />
</div>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">with similar characters all down the first page.
A glance through the rest of the long thin book
revealed the same array of bewildering symbols
to the very last leaf, where the back cover
was missing.</p>

<p>The four sat for a moment in silent astonishment,
trying to make some sense out of the
riddle. Suddenly Margaret had an idea.</p>

<p>"I know! It's shorthand! I've read that
that is writing with funny curves and dots and
wiggly lines."</p>

<p>"No," Corinne gently corrected her, "I don't
think it's shorthand, Margaret. I saw some
shorthand that Father's stenographer wrote
once, and it was quite different from this. Besides,
this seems quite old, as if it were done
many years ago, and shorthand's a comparatively
modern invention, I think."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it must be Chinese or Syrian or
Russian or something like that!" asserted Jess.
"I've seen lots of signs over the stores of foreigners
that don't look so very different from
this. Or&mdash;oh, I know now! it's <i>Greek</i>!"</p>

<p>Corinne laughed. "No indeed, it isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Greek!" she declared. "Father taught me the
Greek alphabet when I was a tiny girl, and
made me learn to know the letters. I'm going
to study it when I go to college. This is entirely
different. I don't believe they're letters
of any other language, either."</p>

<p>She sat in frowning thought over the strange
page for several minutes, while the others
watched her in breathless interest. They, having
no further solutions to offer, threw themselves
unreservedly on her greater resourcefulness.
Jess, meanwhile, refilled the chocolate-cups,
and Bess passed the cake, while
Margaret reveled in such excitement as she had
never before experienced. Corinne still remained
thoughtfully turning the pages. Suddenly
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I have it!&mdash;at least, I <i>think</i> so!"</p>

<p>"What? what? oh, quick!" they begged.</p>

<p>"I think some one has written all this in
what they call a&mdash;a 'cipher.' I've heard of
such things. Father told me people often
send messages over the telegraph or cable in
cipher&mdash;"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>"But what is that? How?" demanded Margaret.</p>

<p>"Why, they have certain words or expressions
which stand for other words or even
whole sentences. And you can't understand
the message unless you have the 'code' or explanation.
For instance, a man may cable
just the words 'Pay Smith' to his broker, and
that may mean 'Buy me five thousand bushels
of wheat to-day.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, but that isn't a bit like what's here,"
argued Margaret.</p>

<p>"No, but it's the same idea," Corinne declared.
"I think in this case some one has
taken certain signs to represent the different
letters of the alphabet. First I thought that
perhaps each sign might stand for a different
word. But that could hardly be, because there
are so many words, one could hardly find signs
enough to go round. And besides, I notice in
looking through the book that there are comparatively
few signs, and they are constantly
repeated." She fell to gazing silently at the
book again, while the others watched, still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
fascinated by the discoveries she was making.
Presently she looked up again.</p>

<p>"I've found out something else, I think.
Do you see that sign of the triangle? Well, if
you notice, that occurs more frequently than
any of the others. In the first five lines there
are more than fourteen of them, and no other
sign happens as frequently as that. Now, if
these signs stand for letters, that couldn't be a
letter, even if it were one of the commonest,
like 'a' or 'i' or 'e'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What <i>can</i> it be then?" whispered Margaret,
in a voice so tense that they all laughed.</p>

<p>"I think it means the <i>space</i> between the
words!" vouchsafed Corinne. "You see,
there'd have to be <i>something</i> to indicate
spaces. You couldn't have the words all
jumbled up together. It wouldn't make
sense!"</p>

<p>"Well, you are wonderful!" sighed Jess,
sitting back on her heels. "I never would have
thought of it in a century!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" laughed Corinne. "There's
nothing wonderful about that. It's only common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
sense and puzzling it out like a riddle.
Now see! If we take it for granted that the
triangle means a space between the words, this
sign of the dot between two triangles must be
either the letter 'a,' 'I' or 'O,' for those are the
only words of just one letter. But you can't
tell which it is till you've puzzled out some
more. And&mdash;after all, this idea may be all
wrong. It may be something quite different,
for all we know!"</p>

<p>"But what can it all be about?" began Jess,
going off on another tack. "And how under
the sun did the thing get hidden away in our old
trunk under a false bottom. It's awfully
mysterious!"</p>

<p>"Tell you what I think," volunteered Corinne.
"Whatever it is, it's been in that trunk
for years and years&mdash;hidden there, perhaps,
when the trunk belonged to some one else. Do
you know where it came from&mdash;the trunk, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't even know whether it was Father's
or Mother's," answered Jess. "But I
can ask Mother. Maybe she'd know."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to puzzle this thing out!" mused
Corinne. "Who knows! Perhaps we'd find
it was something awfully interesting. It's
simply full of mystery and&mdash;and possibilities!"
At this point, Margaret, who during all the
latter conversation had been fidgeting with
impatience, began:</p>

<p>"Now, girls, look here! I've just had the
most delightful idea! We've made the discovery
of something awfully interesting, probably,
if we could only find out what it's all
about. Why not let's form ourselves into a
secret society&mdash;just we four&mdash;with the purpose
of finding out all about this mystery? We
won't let another soul into the secret&mdash;not even
Mother. Oh, it'll be <i>such</i> fun! Do, <i>please</i>!"</p>

<p>She looked imploringly at the twins, and for
once they did not appear to object&mdash;even
looked a trifle interested. For it was the ambition
of Margaret's pitiful, limited little life
to be the member of a "secret society." She
had read much of school fraternities and clubs,
and the fascinating idea had taken a firm root
in her mind. Of course for her&mdash;poor helpless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
little invalid that she was&mdash;there could be
no such thing as membership or participation
in the real organizations. In place of this, she
was forever begging her sisters to form a tiny
society of their own, just the three, and have
meetings and secrets and all the paraphernalia
of the big school "frats."</p>

<p>But the idea had never appealed to the twins.
They had no interest in any of the school clubs
except the basket-ball and tennis teams. And
to have a make-believe one at home with no
earthly or apparent object was something they
had never yet brought themselves to consider,
much as they loved their invalid sister. But
here was something a trifle different! Margaret,
quick to see her advantage, hastened on:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! <i>Do</i> let's have one! Wouldn't
it be a good idea, Corinne? Think of the fun
we'd have, meeting and puzzling out this queer
old book! Perhaps it might lead to something
important, too. And I've even thought
of a name for it,&mdash;we could call it the <i>Antiquarian
Club</i>!"</p>

<p>The latter idea captured Corinne. "That's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
a dandy name for it,&mdash;'Antiquarian Club'! I
<i>like</i> that! And besides, it's true, too, for if
this isn't an antiquity, I'd like to know what
is! Yes, let's have the club!" Corinne was
moved to accept the idea by two impulses.
The notion really did appeal to her, but even
if it hadn't, she would have pretended it did
for the sake of the pathetic little figure in the
invalid-chair, who was rapidly taking a firm
hold of her heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, goody! And you do like the idea, too,
don't you, girls?" exclaimed Margaret. The
twins capitulated unreservedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, we do," said Bess. "I've always detested
such societies because they seemed so
useless. But this thing is really worth having
a club for!"</p>

<p>Margaret, however, had something else on
her mind. "Oh, just one thing more," she
added, a little shyly. "Could I&mdash;could I be&mdash;<i>president</i>?
All clubs have to have a president.
I would so love to be!"</p>

<p>"Indeed you shall!" spoke up Corinne before
either of the others had a chance. "We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
elect you at once&mdash;unanimously&mdash;don't we,
girls? And now, Miss President, you can appoint
the rest of us to other offices!"</p>

<p>Margaret flushed with pleasure. "I appoint
you, Corinne, to be secretary. There
always has to be one of those. And there
usually is a treasurer, if there is any money
to handle. But there won't be here, for we
won't have any dues. So I don't know what
to call the others."</p>

<p>"Let's just be plain members, for the
present," suggested Bess. "And now, what
are we going to do about this book, Miss President?"</p>

<p>"I think we ought to let Corinne take it
home and see if she can puzzle out any more
of it before next meeting," decided Margaret.
"That would be all right, wouldn't it?" They
all agreed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to show it to Father and ask him
what he thinks&mdash;" began Corinne, but Margaret
hastily interrupted:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! You mustn't do <i>that</i>! You
know it's a <i>secret</i> society, and we aren't going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
to tell any one about anything in it. And besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and besides," put in Jess, "if we tell
<i>any one</i> about this book, it might somehow leak
out and get back to Sarah what we'd done in
breaking the trunk, and then there might be
<i>trouble</i>!" She looked meaningly at Bess.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" assented the latter hastily. "We
mustn't tell a soul!" Plainly the twins still
lived in dread of the awful threat made so
many years ago. They knew that Sarah was
even yet fully capable of putting it into execution&mdash;under
sufficient provocation!</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Corinne. "I won't
breathe a word of this, then, and I'll see what
I can do to make head or tail of the thing.
But, mercy!" glancing at her watch, "it's
nearly six o'clock, and I ought to have been
home long ago. I'll take the car at the corner,
I guess." She hurried into her wraps,
gathered up the precious "find" with her
school-books, and bade the girls good-by.</p>

<p>"It's been a remarkable afternoon for me!"
she declared as she kissed Margaret. "I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
like a <i>real</i> antiquarian now. Hurrah for the
Antiquarian Club! Let's have another meeting
as soon as I've made some progress with
this!" She tapped the old account-book significantly
and hurried away.</p>

<p>"Oh!" sighed Margaret, blissfully, settling
back in her chair, "this is positively the most
wonderful day I ever spent in my life! Can
I ever wait for the next meeting?" The twins
stood by her chair, looking thoughtful. They
too were strangely stirred out of their usual
unimaginative selves.</p>

<p>"Well, I confess, I never dreamed of anything
so queer happening in <i>this</i> old ranch!"
marveled Bess. "It's all Corinne's doings."</p>

<p>That night Mrs. Bronson came home very
late from business, but she went in, as was her
invariable custom, to peep at her little invalid
daughter before she herself retired. To her
surprise, she found Margaret still awake.</p>

<p>"Dear, you're not ill, are you?" she inquired
anxiously. "You're usually asleep at this
time."</p>

<p>But Margaret only laughed a happy little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
laugh. "No, Mummy, I'm all right,&mdash;only
just too interested to sleep! Do you remember
what you once said about an <i>adventure</i>
turning up? Well, it has,&mdash;the loveliest kind
of a one! But I can't tell you about it, because
it's a secret. You won't mind, will
you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bronson smiled. "No indeed, I won't
mind! Just as long as you're happy and contented,
I don't mind a thing! Did the twins'
new friend come to see you to-day? And did
you like her?"</p>

<p>At this, Margaret entered on such a vivid
and enthusiastic account of Corinne, that Mrs.
Bronson heaved a sigh of thankfulness for the
new interest in her little girl's empty life.</p>

<p>An hour later Margaret fell asleep to dream,
the night through, of strange, hieroglyphic
symbols, and all the weird things they might
stand for. But not a thing she dreamed of
was as curious as the reality that Corinne was
soon to disclose!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="small">A KEY TO THE MYSTERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> next few days passed in a fever of
impatience for Margaret. Each afternoon
she besieged the twins for news of Corinne
and her progress with the "cipher."
And every day their report was about the
same:</p>

<p>"She thinks she's on the right track, but she
can't tell surely yet. It's pretty difficult, you
know, and Corinne has to study and do other
things, too, besides puzzling over that."</p>

<p>"But has she found out <i>any</i> of the letters?"
Margaret would demand.</p>

<p>"She <i>thinks</i> so, but she can't be sure till she's
made them <i>all</i> out definitely." And Bess
would add, "Now, do be reasonable, Miss President!
Your secretary is doing her very best.
But if you don't think she's a success, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
might take the job away from her and give it
to <i>me</i>!" At which Margaret would chuckle
derisively.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the twins were almost as
anxious as she for a solution of the mystery.
The sudden introduction of this new element
into their hitherto wholly athletic and unimaginative
existences, they found, to their surprise,
even more diverting than the most exciting
tennis-match or basket-ball struggle. About
a week after Corinne's first visit, all three burst
in breathlessly upon Margaret, one cold afternoon,
and transported her to the seventh
heaven of delight with this exciting news:
"Corinne's got it, at last! Haven't you, Corinne!</p>

<p>"Yes," she admitted, giving Margaret a big
hug of greeting, "I think I've puzzled out
most of the letters now, and I've even worked
out a few of the first sentences&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and she says they're awfully strange!"
interrupted the twins, in chorus. "And she
wouldn't tell us a word, though we begged her
hard!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Miss President," laughed Corinne,
"it seemed to me that this was a thing to be revealed
only in a solemn meeting of the club and
in your presence. Was I right?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you were!" declared Margaret.
"Don't you ever tell them a thing before
you've told me, will you?"</p>

<p>"I won't!" promised Corinne. "It shall be
the first rule of our society,&mdash;no discoveries
told to ordinary members before the president
hears them! And now let's get to business!"
They all drew up before the cozy open fire.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't this lovely!" sighed Corinne.
She opened the old account-book and placed
beside it a paper on which she had written the
letters of the alphabet, and next to each the
sign that appeared to stand for it.</p>

<p>"I had the <i>worst</i> time puzzling this out!" she
said. "I worked and worked over it and
changed them all around nearly forty times before
I struck anything that seemed just right.
But now I guess we've got it, at last! I'm
sure 'a' is this perpendicular straight line, 'b'
the rectangle with the bottom missing, 'c' the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
horizontal parallels&mdash;and so on. Now, as
I've said, I've made out the first few sentences
and they seem awfully strange! Here they
are." She turned the paper over and read:</p>

<p>"'This is a house of mystery, and strange,
unaccountable dread. I feel daily that something
menaces me&mdash;that my life is not safe.'"
A delicious shudder ran through the listening
group.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't this <i>gorgeous</i>!" half whispered
Margaret. "It fills me with&mdash;with thrills!"
Corinne went on:</p>

<p>"'Therefore I am keeping this little journal
from time to time. Should aught evil befall
me in this strange land and among these unfriendly
people, at least I will leave some
record whereby my own kin may trace my fate,
perchance, at some future day. I dare not
write this out in good English lest it be discovered
by those who hate me. So I have invented
this secret code, whereof none save myself
knows the key. This book I found in the
library unused and I have taken it. I trust it
will be counted no act of thievery. I keep it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
hidden in the false bottom of my trunk. The
key of the code I have put in another spot.
As soon as my memory has mastered it, I will
destroy it. 'Tis safer.'&mdash;And that's as far as
I got!" ended Corinne.</p>

<p>For a moment they all sat dumb with amazement.</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you make of it?" exclaimed Bess.
"Who is it,&mdash;a man or a woman? When was
it written, and where? Why, I'm just wild to
find out all about it!"</p>

<p>"I confess," admitted Corinne, "that I don't
know <i>what</i> to make of it. I've puzzled and
puzzled over it all day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, good gracious!" interrupted the impatient
Margaret, "of course we can't make
anything out of it till we've worked out some
more! Come ahead! Right now! We're
only wasting time talking about it!"</p>

<p>"That's so!" laughed Corinne. "And when
we can find out right away, by getting to work!
Here, Margaret! You write, while I spell
the thing out!" She thrust the paper and pencil
into Margaret's hands, while the twins hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
over her as she slowly deciphered the sentences:</p>

<p>"'Would&mdash;that&mdash;I&mdash;had&mdash;never&mdash;left&mdash;my&mdash;peaceful&mdash;Bermuda&mdash;'"
Corinne
dropped the book suddenly.</p>

<p>"<i>Bermuda!</i>&mdash;I've been there! Oh, this is
fine!"</p>

<p>"Have <i>you</i> been to Bermuda?" exclaimed
Margaret and the twins, with awe. "When?"</p>

<p>"Last winter, with Father. He was ill, and
we stayed six weeks. It was heavenly!"</p>

<p>"You lucky girl!" sighed Margaret. "But,
go on! We must find out more, right away!"</p>

<p>Corinne took up the book and began anew:
"'But since I did wilfully abandon my home&mdash;aye!&mdash;and
Grandfather, too, even though he
does not love me&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"'Grandfather'?" interrupted Bess. "He
can't be very old, if he has a grandfather living!"</p>

<p>"Doesn't seem likely," murmured Corinne,
spelling out another word under her breath,
then continuing:</p>

<p>"'&mdash;and did in venturesome manner contribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
my aid to the plot against my country,
I must pay the price, I fear. I am watched
constantly. I take no walk abroad, even in
the grounds, but I feel that I am spied upon.
The affection of Madame M. has changed to
dislike. She, too, suspects me. 'Tis hard for
a lass of but sixteen&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"<i>A lass!</i>" shouted all four. "And only <i>sixteen</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, girls!" cried Corinne, rocking back and
forth in her excitement. "She's just like ourselves&mdash;only
a year older than I am! What
<i>can</i> be the trouble&mdash;or rather, what <i>could</i> have
been the trouble with the poor little thing?"</p>

<p>"Go on! go on!" ordered Margaret, with
glistening eyes. "Let's find out!"</p>

<p>Corinne snatched up the book again: "'to be
alone and friendless in a strange land and to
feel so constantly in danger. But I must not
complain. I brought it on myself. As I have
said, Madame M. no longer appears to care
for me. She was so cordial and affectionate at
first, partly for Aunt's sake, no doubt, and
partly because she really seemed to like me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
But since the day when I spoke to Lady &mdash;&mdash;,
at the time her coach broke down, Madame M.
has regarded me only with suspicion.'"</p>

<p>"I wish I knew who 'Madame M.' was, and
'Lady Blank,'" put in Margaret. "How
mysterious she is&mdash;never writing out their full
names!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she didn't dare," said Corinne.
"You see, she says she's in danger. But, oh!&mdash;listen
to what she says next!&mdash;'There is
something which weighs right heavily on my
conscience. 'Tis the matter of the sapphire
signet. But of that I will speak later.'"</p>

<p>"<i>The sapphire signet!</i>" breathed the twins in
a tone of hushed awe. "Doesn't it sound rich
and gorgeous and&mdash;and <i>mysterious</i>! What's
a 'signet,' anyway?"</p>

<p>"I think," explained Corinne, "that it's
another name for a seal&mdash;something with a
monogram or crest or coat-of-arms, used to
stamp on sealing-wax. Father has one set in
a ring&mdash;not a sapphire though&mdash;just some ordinary
stone with his monogram on. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
never uses it, but he told me once that in former
times they were used a great deal when letters
were only sealed with wax. Oh! <i>what</i> do you
suppose this matter of the sapphire signet is
all about! Isn't it wildly exciting? But,
goodness!" glancing at her watch, "it's awfully
late again, and I must get home. The
time goes so fast, and it takes so long to puzzle
all this out!"</p>

<p>"I have an idea!" began Margaret, hesitatingly.
"Suppose <i>I</i> do the puzzling out and
write it down, now that Corinne has discovered
the way. I have so much time that I don't
know what to do with, and this would be so
interesting! Then, when we meet again in a
couple of days, I could read it right off to you
without any trouble. We could get on so
much faster!"</p>

<p>"I think that's splendid!" agreed Corinne.
"And much as I'm crazy to find out right
away what happens, I'd rather wait and hear
a lot of it read at once. Wouldn't you all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a good scheme," admitted Bess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
"except for one thing. How about Sarah?
You'd have a hard time hiding this from her,
Margaret, and you know she simply mustn't
find out!" For a moment they all looked
"stumped." The obstacle seemed almost insuperable,
when Jess had a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>"Tell you what! We'll hide the thing in
the bookcase, way back here behind these old
encyclopedias,&mdash;the account-book, the paper,
and a brand-new fat blank-book that I'll give
you to do all the copying in. You can tell
Sarah to wheel you over to the bookcase because
you want to read. Then, when she's
out of the way, you can work to your heart's
content. But do hide everything whenever
you hear her coming!"</p>

<p>"Oh, good! Just the thing! Sarah'll
never suspect in the world!" laughed Margaret.
"And there's no difficulty about hearing
her coming&mdash;she weighs two hundred and
fifty pounds!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's settled then," said Corinne,
"and I'll have to go. But I'm coming day
after to-morrow, if I can manage to wait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
It's better than the loveliest book I ever read!
Good-by!"</p>

<p>When she had gone, the three sisters sat and
looked at one another with an expression of
sheer wonder on their faces. In one week,
through the agency of this same "queer," quiet
girl, their absolutely uninteresting and commonplace
lives had been transformed into an
unbelievable round of mystery and discovery
and romance. And the strange part of it was
that this same mystery had been lying here&mdash;right
under their noses, so to speak&mdash;all these
years, and they had never even suspected it,
while she had been in the house scarcely half
an hour and had run it straight to earth!
Some such thought was in Margaret's mind
when she presently exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Isn't she just <i>wonderful</i>! I think she's
the most interesting person I ever met in my
life!"</p>

<p>"So do I!" echoed Jess.</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall just dream of this all night!"
whispered Margaret. "It's the most thrilling
thing I ever heard of&mdash;this puzzle-story&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the best of it is, it's all our own. We discovered
it! To-morrow you may envy me,
girls, for I'll be finding out&mdash;all about the
sapphire signet, <i>and</i> what happened next!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="small">"THE LASS OF RICHMOND HILL"</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Two</span> afternoons later, the three active
members of the Antiquarian Club rushed
up the stoop of the Charlton Street house in a
breathless scurry. And Margaret awaited
them in the parlor in a fever of no less eager
excitement.</p>

<p>"Hurry, girls!" she cried when the first
greetings were over. "I've just got heaps to
read to you! And some of it'll make you 'sit
up and take notice,' as Alexander says!"</p>

<p>"Who's Alexander?" queried Corinne, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a boy-cousin who lives with us,"
Bess enlightened her. "He was Mother's sister's
child, and his parents are both dead now,
so Mother had him come here a year or two
ago. He's twelve years old and a perfect
nuisance! He hates girls, so he generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
keeps out of our way. That's why you've
never seen him. But, come on! I'm wild
to hear what's coming next! Margaret
wouldn't tell us a single thing she's found
out."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute before we begin," spoke up
Corinne, "and let's just run over what we've
already discovered. It'll keep us from getting
mixed up. A young girl of sixteen has
run away from her home in Bermuda, and is
in some place where she thinks her life is
in danger. Before she ran away, she did
something to assist in some plot against her
country (which must be Bermuda), and probably
that's one reason why she is in danger.
Maybe something's been discovered about it.
She's staying with a Madame M., and it seems
to be a house of mystery.</p>

<p>"One thing I have pretty well guessed, and
probably so have you all&mdash;that this must have
happened a long time ago. Her language
isn't very&mdash;well, modern&mdash;sounds to me like
stories I've read about old England, and
America too in former times. I think it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
likely she's in one of those two countries when
she writes&mdash;probably England, because she
speaks of '<i>Madame M.</i>' and '<i>Lady Blank</i>,' and
those titles don't somehow go with America.
Then there's something strange about a sapphire
signet. But go on now, Margaret!
Maybe you've discovered something new!"</p>

<p>Margaret smiled mysteriously. "Perhaps
just a <i>few</i> things!" she admitted. "Here's
where we left off. I've copied it all from the
beginning. You remember where she tells
about explaining the signet later? Now I'll
go on:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"There is something strange and evil about this
house. I can trust no one. Especially do I mistrust
the steward. He hath a sleek smile and ingratiating
manners, but he is wicked to the heart of
him. He associates much with one Corbie, who keeps
the tavern down the road hard by the woods. Corbie
has been to this house, and once was closeted long
with the steward. When he came forth to go, he
gazed hard at me as I stood on the lawn. It made
me shudder for an hour afterward."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"That's the first name she has mentioned&mdash;'Corbie,'"
interrupted Corinne. "Let's remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
it. Who knows but it may help
us?"</p>

<p>"There's another coming right away,"
added Margaret, "though I don't know
whether it will be of any help or not.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"But one thing has happened lately to cheer me.
Two nights ago I went to my room, which does not
look toward the river, but toward the back of the
house. I was minded to retire early, having naught
to occupy me through the long evening. Madame M.
retires at nine, but I never see her after the evening
meal. She is usually in conference with the steward,
who has chief charge of the affairs of this great
house. She appears to place much confidence in him.
But that is not to the point.</p>

<p>"I had opened my window and was leaning out a
moment when I heard a softly whistled tune, and knew
that H. was there. For the tune he ever whistles is
'The Lass of Richmond Hill,' which he declared, when
first he brought me here, was right appropriate to
me now."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"I wonder why?" queried Jess.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine," answered Corinne; "'lass'
she certainly is, but what has 'Richmond Hill'
to do with it? What <i>is</i> 'Richmond Hill,' and
where?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother has a friend who lives in Richmond
Hill, Long Island," ventured Bess.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> can't be it!" declared Corinne,
scornfully. "That's only a little new suburb
that's hardly been in existence thirty years!
It has nothing whatever to do with this! And
I wonder who 'H.' is, too. Well, go on, Margaret."</p>

<p>Margaret obediently continued:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"At hearing him, my heart did beat gladly, for he
is the one person I have seen who reminds me of home.
I leaned far out and called to him softly, and presently
he threw into my window a letter weighted with
a stone. It said he and his uncle had not been back
to Bermuda, nor would they dare to go for many a
long day. One of their traitorous sailors had divulged
the plot, and the authorities were wild only to
lay hands on them. This they had learned in roundabout
fashion. They had been cruising along the
coast lately, and had had not a few adventures.
They were sailing at midnight for parts unknown.
He did but come up hastily to see how I fared, before
they left.</p>

<p>"In a moment I threw down an answering missive,
telling of my present plight, and begging that he
and his uncle would take me back to Bermuda should
they ever be sailing there again. That was all I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70&ndash;72</a></span>
time for, since he knew he dared not linger. He went
away silently into the night. 'Twas brave of him
to come, since he knows it would be ill for him to be
seen hereabout, now that so much seems to have been
discovered."</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_071.jpg" alt="Gazing" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small">"He gazed hard at me as I stood on the lawn"</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Margaret paused here and half whispered:
"Hold your breath now, girls! We're coming
to the <i>sapphire signet</i>!" Then she went
on with the reading:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"I must now explain about the sapphire signet.
Night after night I lie awake and ask myself why I
ever took it&mdash;why I was ever tempted to add this
mistake to the rest of my misdoings. At the time it
seemed no wrong,&mdash;nay, it seemed entirely <i>right</i> that
I should take with me what Grandfather has so often
said was mine, though he deemed it safer not to allow
me to have it in my keeping till I should come of age.</p>

<p>"'Tis such a pretty bauble&mdash;this wonderful blue
stone larger than my thumb-nail, with our family
crest graved on it and set all round the edge with
tiny, sparkling diamonds. Grandfather told me that
the sapphire was once in a great ring, and from generation
to generation had been handed down to the
eldest son of the family. He said, moreover, that it
ever should have remained a ring; that 'twas a crime
it should have been changed. But 'twas my mother's
whim that it should be taken from the ring, set round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
with diamonds, and made into an ornament for her
neck. He said that once, when they were in London
not long after their marriage, she wheedled my father
into having it changed, and came home to Bermuda
with the jewel hanging from a slender chain about
her white throat. And Grandfather was filled with
wrath at her and never forgave her. Had I been a
boy, he says, he would have had the stone reset in a
ring. But since the only heir to it is a girl, he has
allowed it to remain thus, and once scornfully told
me that 'twas 'as useless now as I was,' and might
as well so remain.</p>

<p>"On rare occasions, Grandfather has let me wear
it&mdash;once to a grand tea-drinking at St. George's,
where 'twas much admired. But mainly he has kept
it in his great strong box. It seemed no harm that
day for me to take it. The box stood invitingly
open. The jewel was really mine, and I possessed
no other ornament. Even then I realized that I
might never see my home or Grandfather again. So
I took it&mdash;Heaven forgive me!&mdash;thinking it no wrong.
But I have come to feel differently since. In these
long, lonely months, when I have had so much time
to think and to regret, I can see how this act of mine
must appear to Grandfather and to all who know
me. Even though it was in effect my own, it was still
in his keeping, and I should never have taken it without
his consent. I dare not even wonder what he
must think of me, and I live only for the opportunity
to return home and place the signet in his hands.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>"From the very first I have never dared openly to
wear the beautiful thing; and since my conscience began
to trouble me, I have never wished to. Long
since, I removed it from its velvet riband and concealed
it. Nor must I, even here, disclose where it is
hidden. To do so would be neither safe nor wise.
Suffice it that I will never more wear the bauble till
I have restored it to its rightful keeper, my grandfather."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Margaret paused again, and there was a
blissful sigh from all her assembled listeners.</p>

<p>"Isn't it the most fascinating thing&mdash;this
sapphire signet business?" exclaimed Corinne,
at last. "I can just imagine how the poor girl
felt. She hadn't meant any harm in taking
it&mdash;it had seemed perfectly <i>right</i>. And then
her conscience got to troubling her till she
hadn't a peaceful minute! But where in the
world could she have hidden it? Does it tell
later on, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Not that I've discovered as yet, but there
are a lot of other interesting things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on, go on then!" chorused the waiting
three, impatient of anything that broke the
thread of the story.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, the next seems to be written some
time later, but I can't tell how much. This is
something like a diary, only she doesn't put
down any dates. She just seems to leave
spaces between the different entries. It's
kind of confusing. Now she says:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"A strange thing happened last night. At midnight
I awoke. I heard confused sounds on the road
without. Carts creaking by, men shouting and
calling, women crying, and children screaming as
with fright. The sounds continued till near morning.
An endless procession of carts and coaches.
'Twould seem as though the whole city were in flight.
'Twas odd to hear so much racket in this quiet region.</p>

<p>"To-day the whole household is in agitation. Fear
seems to have seized on all. The servants are in a
panic. Only the steward seems undisturbed. Madame
M. is calm in manner, but I can see that she is
much perturbed inwardly."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"What in the world could have been happening?"
demanded Bess. "She speaks of the
'city.' I wonder what city, and what was the
matter? Why should every one be leaving it?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking all along that she was
somewhere in England," suggested Corinne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
"though I can't imagine what part. Anyway&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" cried Margaret. "Why don't you
let me go on?"</p>

<p>"That's so!" agreed Corinne. "It's foolish
not to see what's coming before we try to make
sense of it. Go on!"</p>

<p>Margaret continued. "Next she says:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Some of the servants left yesterday. I now know
the cause. The rebels are threatening to take possession
of the city. Ships filled with soldiers stand
in the waters near by. 'Tis feared there will be a
great battle soon. Madame M. is very ill. She has
taken to her bed. I think great fear has made her
so&mdash;and great anger. She is being cared for by the
housekeeper, Mistress Phœbe. I have come to like
Mistress Phœbe. She is the one soul who treats me
with kindness unfailing. She, too, hates the steward.
She told me so. She and the steward and one other
servant are all that are left here now. The rest have
fled. Would that the steward had fled also! He
seems to have some urgent reason for remaining. He
has had another interview with Corbie, in this house."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Wait a minute!" interrupted Corinne, once
more. "I have an idea. I am going to put
down on a paper every name she mentions, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
matter how insignificant, and see if they will
lead us to any sort of a clue. <i>Names</i> are
about the only clues for finding out things,
when you come to think of it!" She hunted in
her bag for a pencil and notebook. Then she
continued:</p>

<p>"Now, there's 'Bermuda'&mdash;that was the
first, and the only real definite thing we've discovered
yet&mdash;and 'London.' Then there's
'Madame M.,' which doesn't help much. And
'Lady Blank' is no good at all, nor is 'H.'
'Corbie' may be useful, but I don't think Mistress
Phœbe' will&mdash;and that's all, I guess."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," contradicted Margaret.
"You forgot the 'Lass of Richmond Hill'!"</p>

<p>"True enough! Of course that's only the
name of a song, but I'll put it down. Who
knows but what it <i>may</i> be the most important
of all! I have a book of old songs at home,
and I have just a faint idea that there's one
of that name in it. I'll hunt it up to-night.
But as usual, it's late, and I must be hurrying
along. Haven't you read about all you've
puzzled out, Margaret?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>"I've done another entry," replied Margaret,
slowly and mysteriously, "and perhaps
you'd better hear it. It may be worth your
while!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it?" cried Corinne, pausing in
the act of adjusting her hat. "Quick!"</p>

<p>"Here it is:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Madame M. sent for me to-day. 'Tis the first
time since she took to her bed. She did so to give
me this strange warning. These be her very words:
'It is rumored that this house may soon be taken possession
of by rebels. If so, I wish you to have no
communication with any of them, Mistress Alison."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>There was an instant's silence. Then Corinne
threw her hat on a chair and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hurrah! At <i>last</i> we have this mysterious
lassie's name! It's <i>Alison</i>! That's the biggest
discovery yet. Is there any more?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one thing," answered Margaret, "the
strangest of all. It's a later entry and is only
three words long&mdash;the first word twice underlined:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="doubleUnderline">He</span> has come!"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="small">A SURPRISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> girls got together again on the following
afternoon, for they could not possibly
have stretched their patience to the limit of
another day! Margaret had promised to work
like a Trojan till they arrived and to have
much to read to them. It was with breathless
interest that they drew their chairs around her.</p>

<p>"My! I couldn't study a thing, or keep
my mind off this a single minute to-day in
school!" sighed Jess. "I guess I failed in
every blessed recitation."</p>

<p>"Me too!" echoed Bess. "If this suspense
doesn't come to an end soon, I'll be a failure
for the term!"</p>

<p>"Same here!" agreed Corinne. "I do envy
Margaret, for she at least can be working at
it all day and satisfying her curiosity. Have
you discovered much more, honey?" Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
smiled her slow, mysterious smile. She
was certainly enjoying herself, in a brand-new
fashion these days. And between meetings
she guarded her secrets like a veritable sphinx.</p>

<p>"Something's happening right along!" she
answered enigmatically. "But I've rather a
surprise for you to-day."</p>

<p>"What is it?" they demanded in one voice.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't tell you till we come to it!" was
her maddening reply. "Shall I go on now?"</p>

<p>"Just a minute," said Corinne. "I want to
say that I looked up that old song last night.
In this collection I have, there is given a little
history of each song. Now, 'The Lass of
Richmond Hill' was written about a young
girl, a Miss Janson, who lived on Richmond
Hill, which is near the little town of Leybourne,
in England. It was written way back
about 1770, and the song was said to be a
favorite of King George the Third. It was
quite popular at the time. That's absolutely
all about it. Of course, it's possible that place
may be the one where Alison was, but somehow
I don't feel very sure of it. I rather think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
what she says about 'Richmond Hill' must have
some other connection. Now go on, Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Very well," began Margaret. "We left
off with the words, '<i>He</i> has come!' <i>He</i> seems
to be a very mysterious person, and some one
of great importance evidently. She goes on
to say:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"The house has been put at his disposal. Not,
however, by Madame M., for she would gladly slam
the door in his face were she able, but she is still in
bed, ill. He is very considerate, and does naught to
disturb or annoy her. His servants and men are all
about, but they do not molest any of the household.
Phœbe remains the housekeeper and caters for him.
She adores him, as does her father, so she tells me.</p>

<p>"I have exchanged no words with him. I have
only seen him as he sits in the library or walks about
the grounds. He is absent much&mdash;away in the city,
Phœbe says. He is handsome and grave and stern,
but I think he is kind and gentle. I long to speak
with him, but I dare not. I am too carefully
watched.</p>

<p>"The steward is still here, and frequents much Corbie's
tavern. He asked me yesterday a few questions
about Bermuda. I did not care to have speech
with him so I cut him short. He gave me an ugly
look as he walked away."</p>
</blockquote>


                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret stopped here to say, "Now comes
something exciting!"</p>

<p>The listening three sighed ecstatically.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"There have been strange doings in this house. I
have now turned spy myself. Last night at a late
hour, when all the household was asleep, I heard
stealthy footsteps passing my door. The sound was
most unusual, for <i>he</i> was away in the city, and there
was consequently no guard. When the footsteps
were past, I rose, opened my door, and peeped out.
I saw the steward. He was tiptoeing softly down the
hall toward the stairs, a candle in his hand. A sudden
resolve seized me. I would follow him in the
dark, and see what he did. I felt sure he planned
some evil. I seized a dark-colored shawl, drew it
round me, and, in the shadow, crept after the light
of his candle.</p>

<p>"Down the stairs he went, and I felt sure he would
pause on the lower floor and perchance enter <i>his</i> room
to rifle it. I crouched on the stair and held my
breath, but he passed on and opened a door which
gives on the stone steps leading to the wine-cellar.
Once he glanced back suspiciously, then the door
closed behind him. As soon as I dared, I followed.
Opening the door with the greatest caution, I peered
down. His back was toward me, and he was drinking
from an upturned bottle. In a moment he put the
bottle back on its shelf and stood long in thought.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"I was about to conclude that this was all he had
come for and that my fears were for naught, when he
turned aside, took a knife from his pocket, and went
toward the far end of the cellar, leaving the stairway
in heavy shadow. Taking advantage of this, I crept
down the steps and watched him from the shelter of
one of the pillars that supported the floor above. In
a moment he stopped, raised his hand, and felt along
the great beam above his head. I noted 'twas the
second beam from the end. At a distance of about
ten feet from the wall he pushed his knife-blade into
the timber, and, behold! something like a small door
fell open!</p>

<p>"Into the aperture thus left he thrust his two
hands, and drew forth a small iron box. This he
placed on the ground near the candle, and pressing a
spring, threw back the lid. It seemed to be filled
with papers, and with something else that shone in the
candle-light. The latter, I soon learned, was a mass
of golden coins, for he plunged in his hand, took out
a fistful, and put them in a small leather bag he carried.
Then he closed the box, put it back in the hollow
space, and shut the door of the secret opening in
the beam. I stayed to see no more, but fled hastily
to my room. 'Tis all most strange. What hides
he in this secret place? Whose gold is that? What
evil does he plot?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Isn't that the most exciting thing you ever
heard?" demanded Margaret, breaking off.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>"Frightfully exciting!" agreed every one.</p>

<p>"It's like an adventure in a book&mdash;only better!"
added Corinne. "But, Margaret, is <i>that</i>
the surprise you had for us?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't! That's coming just a little
later. The next entry says:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"<i>She</i> has come! <i>He</i> seems most glad to have his
lady with him once more. I have not yet spoken
with her. She has only passed me, bowing with
stately courtesy. I think she has forgotten how I
once spoke with her. No wonder. Her mind is filled
with anxious care. Madame M. is still confined to
her bed, and knows not that <i>she</i> is here. I think
Madame M. is truly right ill."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"<i>She</i> must be <i>his</i> wife, I suppose," interrupted
Bess. "I do wish Alison would call
'em by their names! This is so confusing!"</p>

<p>Margaret only stopped long enough to say:
"Now, the surprise is coming. This is the
next entry:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"<i>He</i> passed me in the hall to-day and wished me a
good morning in his grave, courtly fashion. Then he
inquired after the health of Madame M., and offered
to send her up some fruit that he had just received
for his table. I knew not what to say. I was right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
embarrassed. For Madame M. will accept naught
from him, and&mdash;"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Margaret stopped short.</p>

<p>"Go on, go on!" they chorused.</p>

<p>"I can't!" she answered.</p>

<p>"Why not?" they inquired in wonder.</p>

<p>"Because that's <i>all there is</i>!" she replied
quietly. "We've come to the end. That's
the surprise I had for you!"</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" ejaculated Bess in disgust,
picking up the old account-book and examining
it curiously. The back cover was missing,
and it was not difficult to conjecture that many
pages might also be lacking.</p>

<p>"That's the <i>queerest</i>!" mused Corinne.
"Of course, the book is rather thin, but I
hadn't imagined that we'd finish it so soon.
Those characters are large, and take up more
room than plain writing, I suppose. But, my
gracious!" She got up and began pacing
around the room impatiently. "This is perfectly
<i>maddening</i>! To have it leave off in
such a place, without a sign of explanation of
it all! Where's the other part of that book?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Could it possibly be in the old trunk where we
found this? Let's go up and see!"</p>

<p>"No use in doing that," said Jess, "because
Sarah's done exactly what she threatened to&mdash;locked
the attic door and hid the key. But
anyhow, I remember distinctly that there
wasn't a sign of anything else under that false
bottom. It was absolutely empty after this
fell out. Wherever the rest is, it isn't there!"</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Corinne, coming to an
abrupt pause in her impatient tramping,
"there's one thing I'm firmly determined
upon! I sha'n't rest day or night till I've
found some sort of an explanation for all this!
Do the rest of you agree with me? It's the
most fascinating mystery I ever came across,
outside of a story-book, and I'm bound I'm
not going to be stumped by any obstacles!"</p>

<p>"We surely do agree with you!" echoed
Margaret. "We're just as crazy as you are
to unravel it all. And what's an antiquarian
club good for, I'd like to know, if not for
something just like this! That's our business
from now on!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"The motion's carried!" agreed Bess.
"But how in the world are we going to go
about it? Somehow it seems as if we'd
reached a stone wall a mile high&mdash;no getting
around it or over it!"</p>

<p>"Then we'll tunnel <i>under</i> it!" laughed Corinne.
"But first of all, there's a question
I'd like to settle. Where did that old hair-trunk
come from? How did it get in this
house? Who owned it before you did?"</p>

<p>"I can answer that," replied Margaret, "for
I asked Mother about it the other night. I
did it in a roundabout sort of way, so she
wouldn't suspect why I wanted to know or
think it queer that I asked. She said it belonged
to Father. He told her once that a
friend of his, a sea-captain, had given it to him
years ago. The captain said it was an heirloom
that had been in the family many years.
An ancestor of his had found it in a vessel
that had been wrecked, and had been floating
around for several months&mdash;a 'derelict,'
Mother called it. This old captain said it was
so handy and substantial that he had carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
it with him on all his voyages. But as he
wasn't going to sail any more, and hadn't any
children to leave it to, he gave it to Father."</p>

<p>"Well, at least it explains one thing&mdash;how
this strange book came to be in your house,"
mused Corinne. "But it doesn't help a bit
about unraveling the rest of the mystery, after
all. Now, the next thing is to go over all this
writing carefully, and see if we can find anything
we've overlooked that might be a clue.
Oh, girls, I wish you'd let me show this to
Father! He'd be <i>so</i> interested, and perhaps
he could help us with it, too!"</p>

<p>"Well, as far is I'm concerned, you're welcome
to," answered Bess, and Jess nodded her
head vigorously in assent. But Margaret
cried out pleadingly:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Corinne! Don't do that yet!
It would spoil all our lovely secret society to
have grown folks know about it. Let's wait
awhile and see what we can do ourselves. And
then if we find we can't make any headway,
I'll consent to telling Corinne's father."</p>

<p>She was so earnest and so pathetic in her appeal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
that not one of the others had the heart
to deny her request, knowing, as they did, what
the little club and its absorbingly interesting
secret meant to her shut-in, circumscribed life.</p>

<p>"Very well, honey! We will do just as you
say!" agreed Corinne, giving her a hug.
"Now let's read this whole thing over, and see
if we can unearth a clue."</p>

<p>They started once more at the beginning,
reading slowly and thoughtfully through the
strange record till they came again to the allusion
"The Lass of Richmond Hill." Suddenly
Margaret interrupted:</p>

<p>"I've thought of something! I lay awake
a good part of last night, because my back was
hurting me, and I had a chance to think of
things rather hard. And then, some things
we unearthed to-day and what Corinne found
out about that old song made this idea pop into
my head just now. You remember she said
the song was written about 1770 and was a
favorite of George the Third? That made me
think of the Revolution. And then I suddenly
remembered what Alison had said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
'rebels.' Girls, you can take my word for it&mdash;all
this thing happened right here in America,
and during the Revolutionary War! Can't
you see it?"</p>

<p>Corinne sat up very straight for a moment.
Then she burst out:</p>

<p>"We're a pack of <i>lunatics</i>&mdash;all but Margaret.
She's the only one that's got a grain
of common sense! Of <i>course</i> it was during
the Revolution&mdash;every other word Alison says
points to it! And that being the case, the
rest is easy! Good-by! I'm going straight
home to look up Revolutionary history!"</p>

<p>And flinging on her hat and coat, without
further ceremony of farewell, she was off,
leaving the three staring speechlessly after
her!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="small">THE DISCOVERIES CORINNE MADE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Corinne</span> did not reappear for nearly a
week. During all that time the twins,
who only saw her in school, reported that she
would have nothing to say to them outside of
this statement:</p>

<p>"Let me alone, girls, just for a while. I'm
working hard at it. When I've run to earth
something worth while, I'll tell you, and we'll
have another meeting!" And that was absolutely
all they could get from her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Margaret was passing the slow
days in a fever of impatience and baffled expectation.
Now that she no longer had her
mind occupied by puzzling out the curious old
journal and could only sit and wait for the
results of Corinne's work, she grew terribly
restless. So much so, indeed, that the lynx-eyed
Sarah, who watched her beloved charge
like a cat, made up her mind that Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
was beginning to have symptoms of a real
fever. She prepared, therefore, a huge bowl
of boneset tea to be taken in instalments.</p>

<p>Now, if there was any one thing under the
sun that Margaret hated more than another,
it was boneset tea! And, moreover, in this
case she knew that there was absolutely no need
of the remedy. But this she dared not confide
to Sarah lest she awaken fresh suspicion in
that handmaiden's already too suspicious mind.
So she swallowed her bitter doses uncomplainingly,
and longed for Corinne's coming for
more reasons than one!</p>

<p>And then at last, six days later, Corinne
came flying home with the twins one afternoon,
and all three burst in unexpectedly on the delighted
Margaret. Corinne was armed with a
load of volumes that were plainly not school-books,
and these she planked down on the floor
beside the invalid-chair with just one brief remark:</p>

<p>"<i>I've got it!</i>"</p>

<p>Questions and inquiries were hurled at her
thick and fast, but not one of them would she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
answer till all were seated about Margaret's
chair in the usual half-circle by the open fire.
Then she began quietly, but with much suppressed
excitement in her voice:</p>

<p>"Yes, girls, I've got it&mdash;at last! I'm going
to tell you all about it, and you're going
to have the surprise of your lives! It took me
a long while before I struck just the right clue.
I've spent about every afternoon reading at
the library near us. I even went up to the big
one at Forty-second Street yesterday. And
every evening at home has found me still digging
at it. I've neglected my school work
completely, and have failed in everything this
week; but I don't care!</p>

<p>"Margaret's a trump! She put us all on
the right track in the first place by sensibly
suggesting the Revolution. That was fine!
But, of course, the subject was a big one and
concerned the whole thirteen original colonies.
In thinking it over, I decided that since Alison
came from Bermuda, the 'city' she keeps speaking
of would most likely be the <i>nearest</i> one to
Bermuda. On looking it up, I found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
nearest was Charleston, South Carolina. So
I started in and hunted up every bit of Revolutionary
history I could find about Charleston,
but never a thing did I strike that helped a
bit.</p>

<p>"Then I gave that up and tried another city.
As there didn't seem to be any very likely
places south of Charleston, I turned north and
tried Richmond, Baltimore and Philadelphia.
Not a single thing in any one of them that
threw a ray of light on our troubles! Finally,
I began on New York&mdash;and hit it right away!"
Her listeners gave a little jump. "Yes, right
here in old New York. And come to think of
it, that <i>was</i> the most likely place, after all, and
I might have saved myself all that other
bother, if only I'd used a little common sense!"</p>

<p>"But how did you know right away that it
was New York?" demanded Margaret.</p>

<p>"Why, the simplest thing in the world!
Almost the first thing I came across, in reading
up about New York during the Revolution,
was about a place called&mdash;<i>Richmond
Hill</i>!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>"What? Where?" they all cried in one
breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, Richmond Hill! It was the name of
a big mansion and estate outside of the city,
and was a very famous place in its time."</p>

<p>"But how did you know it had anything to
do with Alison?" they demanded incredulously.</p>

<p>"Well, just about twenty things pointed to
it without a doubt. I'll tell you all about it.
In the first place, I read that this mansion was
built in 1760 by the paymaster-general of the
British army, and his name was&mdash;<i>Abraham
Mortier</i>!"</p>

<p>She stopped significantly, but no one seemed
to catch her meaning till Margaret suddenly
cried:</p>

<p>"Madame M.!"</p>

<p>"Precisely!" said Corinne. "I wondered if
you'd catch it. 'Madame M.' must have been
Madame Mortier, his wife, of course!"</p>

<p>"But Alison didn't say anything about
<i>Abraham</i> Mortier," objected Bess.</p>

<p>"That's just it,&mdash;she didn't, because Madame
Mortier was then a widow. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
husband died quite suddenly, just at the outbreak
of the war. So <i>that's</i> accounted for.
And don't you remember that Alison said
Madame M. allowed the steward to transact
all the business of the household. She
wouldn't be doing that if her husband were
alive! Well, except for that, I couldn't find
out another thing about the Mortiers. History
doesn't mention them again. But it tells
a lot about other things we're interested in.
To begin with, after the siege of Boston, Washington
came to New York, and was there
several months. Now then, while he was in
the city, he made his headquarters at&mdash;Richmond
Hill! What does that suggest to you?"</p>

<p>Again they all looked blank for a moment,
and once more Margaret was first to catch the
idea.</p>

<p>"I've got it! Washington is the 'he' that
Alison says so much about but never names!"</p>

<p>"Right!" cried Corinne.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" clamored the less astute
twins.</p>

<p>"This way," explained Corinne, "Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
that Alison says about 'him' tallies with
the descriptions of Washington&mdash;'grave, courteous,
stately, kindly, thoughtful.' There
isn't a shadow of doubt! She speaks of his
servants and men and guards. Only a commander-in-chief
would be likely to have all that
retinue."</p>

<p>Suddenly Jess, who had been deep in
thought, interrupted: "But, see here! If it
was Washington, why did Madame M. act so
hateful about him? Alison said if she hadn't
been sick, she'd have gladly slammed the door
in his face. I don't understand it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's <i>easy</i>! Madame Mortier was,
without doubt, a <i>Tory</i>! You know, New
York was full of Tories at the time, and they
hated Washington and all the rebels like&mdash;like
poison!"</p>

<p>"But I still don't understand," insisted Jess,
"how, if Madame Mortier was a Tory and
hated Washington so, he should come to be
using her house for his headquarters. I don't
wonder she was furious!"</p>

<p>"I thought of that too," said Corinne, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
it seemed strange to me; but, from what I've
read, I think it was this way: he had to have
his headquarters somewhere while he was in
New York, and just at first he had them way
down in the lower part of the city, in the Kennedy
house. But later he wanted to get outside
of the city for some reason; perhaps it was
on account of one of those plagues of smallpox
or yellow fever that were always breaking out
there. Then, of course, there were so few
houses outside that he had to take anything he
could find that was suitable. So he chose
Richmond Hill, and Lady Washington followed
him there later."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" again demanded the
ever-skeptical listeners.</p>

<p>"Well, didn't Alison say, just toward the
last, that 'his lady' had come?"</p>

<p>"True enough!" assented Jess. "And that
makes me think of something else. Was that
the 'Lady Blank' she spoke of first, do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Without doubt, for she even says, 'I do not
think she remembers me.' But where or how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
she met her before, I haven't had time to work
out. Anyhow, it explains why Madame Mortier
began to be suspicious of Alison. Of
course she would be if she was such a staunch
Tory and found Alison talking to the wife of
her worst enemy!</p>

<p>"But here's something very important, and
it's the <i>real</i> proof of the whole thing. The
rest was just rather easy guesswork. Do you
know, while Washington was at Richmond
Hill, that summer of 1776, the Tories in the
city got up a big plot to kill him, blow up his
fortifications, massacre all his soldiers, and
spoil everything for the Americans? <i>And</i>&mdash;it
very nearly was accomplished, only some one
discovered it and gave the whole thing away.
<i>That's</i> the plot, evidently, which was brewing
when Alison felt that something strange and
mysterious was going on. And here's my
positive proof: one of the chief conspirators
in the plot was a man who kept a tavern near
the edge of the woods close to Washington's
headquarters, and his name was&mdash;<i>Corbie</i>!"</p>

<p>"Didn't we <i>say</i> that name would be of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
help?" cried Margaret, excitedly. "Why, all
this seems like a fairy story coming true! Is
there anything else, Corinne?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's one other thing. But before
I tell you, I'm curious to know why you
haven't asked one question."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why, the exact location of Richmond Hill.
You haven't exhibited the least curiosity about
that!"</p>

<p>"But you said it was outside of the city somewhere,"
put in Bess, "and I suppose it was up
around Fordham or West Farms, or even
White Plains. It must have been pretty far
out."</p>

<p>Corinne laughed. "Do you realize that the
'city' only extended to about City Hall Park
in those days? And all beyond that was out
in the country! No, Richmond Hill was <i>right
here in Greenwich Village</i>!"</p>

<p>They all stared at her in such frank amazement
that she broke into a giggle.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think that's rather astonishing,
but I've something to say that's even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
more so. I told you I'd give you the surprise
of your lives, and here it is: the exact spot
where the Richmond Hill mansion stood was&mdash;<i>just
about where this house stands now</i>!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="small">BAFFLED!</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">If</span> Corinne thought to create a sensation by
her last disclosure, she was gratified beyond
her wildest expectations. It was not, however,
what they all <i>said</i> (for they were rendered
literally speechless by surprise), but the
way they <i>looked</i> that caused her to go almost
into hysterics of laughter. If she had informed
them that there was a lighted bomb about to
go off in the cellar, they could not have assumed
more open-mouthed, startled expressions!</p>

<p>"Oh, don't look so stunned!" she panted, at
length, weak with laughter. "It won't hurt
you!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;b-but&mdash;" stammered Margaret, and
at last brought out the eternal question, "how&mdash;how
do you know?"</p>

<p>"The way I know is this, and in order to
explain it, I might as well tell you the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
history of the place. It won't take long, and
it will make you understand better. We know
how Richmond Hill began, so I won't go over
that. After the battle of Long Island and
Washington's retreat from New York, we
don't hear a thing about it till the end of the
war. About that time it was the headquarters
of the British general, Sir Guy Carleton.
After the war, when Washington became
President and New York the capital, Richmond
Hill was taken by Vice-President John
Adams as his residence till the capital was removed
to Washington.</p>

<p>"Then Aaron Burr took it, lived there a
number of years, improved the place a lot, and
made the grounds very beautiful. I must tell
you right now that the place was a <i>hill</i> at that
time, about a hundred feet high, and had a
fine view over the Hudson. The river was
nearer too, just a few feet beyond Greenwich
Street. That hardly seems possible, for it's
blocks farther off now. But in later years they
filled it in and made a lot more space to build
on, and that has moved the river banks farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
away. Well, Burr lived here with his wife
and a lovely little daughter, Theodosia, till
after he killed Hamilton in the duel. Then
he had to give the place up, and it was sold.</p>

<p>"After that, a number of different people
lived there till 1817. Then the city began to
reach up this way, and they decided to put
regular streets through here and make city
blocks. Of course they couldn't leave a high
hill like that standing, so they leveled it and
lowered the house gradually to the street, and
it stood somewhere right about here. I can't
make out the <i>very</i> spot, for some books say
it was on the north side of Charlton Street,
and others, on the south side. And one even
said it faced on Varick Street. But anyway,
right near this spot it stood; and as no one
seemed to want such a big place for a residence
any more, it became a sort of hotel or tavern.</p>

<p>"Then, some one else bought it and turned
it into a theater, and for several years it was
called the Richmond Hill Theater. But it
wasn't very successful, so after a while it was
sold again, and this time became a menagerie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
and circus. Later it was turned into a tavern
again. But at last, in 1849, it was so old and
rickety that they tore it down and put up these
nice little houses over the place where it stood.
That's all there is about it. Now are you convinced
that I wasn't crazy?"</p>

<p>"It seems too wonderful to be true!" sighed
Margaret. "To think we're living right on
the spot where all these strange things happened
to Alison! I can scarcely believe I'm
not asleep and dreaming all this. But, oh,
there are so many questions I want to ask!
For instance, I can't yet understand how it was
that if Madame Mortier was a Tory, Washington
could have his headquarters at her house.
Couldn't she have forbidden it?"</p>

<p>"Why, it seems to be this way," answered
Corinne. "In war time then, as well as now,
the army that was occupying a city could do
about as it pleased&mdash;used all the houses and
food and so forth that it felt inclined to,
whether the things belonged to the enemy or
not. Sometimes they would pay the people for
them, and sometimes they didn't&mdash;just <i>took</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
them. I suppose Washington had to have
headquarters out of town for some reason, and
the only available place was Richmond Hill.
He was probably sorry enough to cause Madame
Mortier any inconvenience, and no doubt
he offered her all reasonable compensation.
For I read in one book that Washington made
it a rule that this should be done whenever it
was necessary to use any one's house or goods.
If she didn't like it, he couldn't help that.
Matters were too serious for him to quibble
about such things.</p>

<p>"That's my only explanation of your question,
Margaret. But what puzzles me even
more is how did Alison come to be there at all?
Who was she? Why did she leave Bermuda,
and what did she do before she left it that
caused her to be under suspicion?"</p>

<p>As no one could throw any light on these
mysteries, they all remained silent a moment.
Suddenly Jess, who had been turning the
pages of the blank-book in which Margaret
had copied the journal, broke out with this demand:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>"What <i>I'd</i> like to know is the explanation
of this: 'A strange thing happened last night.
At midnight I awoke. I heard confused
sounds on the road without&mdash;carts creaking by,
men shouting, women crying, and babies
screaming.' Now what do you suppose it was
all about?"</p>

<p>"I think I can explain that," answered Corinne,
who seemed literally saturated with historical
information since her recent researches.
"In February of 1776, while Washington was
still besieging the British at Boston, he sent
General Lee down to New York to begin fortifying
it. Lee and his forces arrived in the
city on the very day that Sir Henry Clinton,
the British commander, sailed into the harbor
with a fleet of vessels. Well, the city just
about went into a panic, for every one was certain
there would be a big battle right off! And
the histories say just what Alison did&mdash;that
they all began to pack up and move out of the
way as quick as they could, and all night the
roads were filled with carts, and coaches, and
crying women and children. Every one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108&ndash;110</a></span>
scared to death! It proved to be a false alarm,
for Clinton sailed right off again, and Lee only
tended to the business of fortifying.</p>

<p>"But, you notice, Alison says that was when
all the servants ran away but two, and Madame
Mortier got sick and went to bed. She
must have been sick a long time, for Washington
didn't get there till April or May, and
she was still in bed then. Perhaps she was
quite an old lady and had had a severe shock.
Maybe she was delicate anyway. And she
evidently must have heard that her house was
to be made use of, because she sent for Alison
and warned her about it, and that she wasn't
to have any communication with the rebels.
Madame Mortier must have been a <i>Tartar</i>!"</p>

<p>"But tell us more about the plot!" cried Margaret.
"That's the main thing, after all.
How did they intend to kill Washington?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_109.jpg" alt="Warning" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small">"Madame Mortier warned Allison that she wasn't to have any<br /> communication with the rebels"</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Why, I read in one book that some one was
to put poison in a dish of peas, but somehow
Washington was warned about it ahead of
time and didn't eat them, of course. But he
learned all about the plot, and he had a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the conspirators arrested. One of them was
courtmartialed and hanged, as a proof that
such performances didn't pay. I'm glad
<i>somebody</i> was punished for trying to do such
an abominable thing, anyway!"</p>

<p>"Well, one thing I'm convinced of!" declared
Bess. "That wicked old steward had a
lot to do with the scheme. Don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"He certainly must have," agreed Corinne.
"But what do you suppose he was doing down
there in the cellar when Alison saw him that
night, and why did he hide things in that place
in the beam? And what part did Alison take
in the plot, anyway? Isn't it simply distracting
that her journal is torn off right there!
And where <i>can</i> the rest of it be, and why was
it torn at all? And why was this part saved
so carefully? And what became of the sapphire
signet? Seems to me as though I'd go
crazy with all these unanswered questions
pounding away in my brain!"</p>

<p>Nobody having any solutions to offer, again
they all sat quietly for a while, till Margaret's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
eye happened to light on the pile of books that
Corinne had laid on the floor.</p>

<p>"What are those, Corinne?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are some books on New York City
history that I got out of the library to read
up. Each one has something about Richmond
Hill in it. And this one even has a picture of
the house. See! here it is."</p>

<p>They all crowded around her to look.
"What a fine-looking place!" was the general
comment. And Bess added:</p>

<p>"Does it seem possible that this shabby old
neighborhood ever looked like that delightful
country-place!"</p>

<p>"It was the most beautiful residence anywhere
around New York for a long while,"
said Corinne. "The grounds were fine too,
and the big gateway to the estate was right
where the corner of Spring and Macdougal
streets is now. I thought you might like to
read these books, Margaret, so I brought them
for you. But oh, girls!" she ended; "right
here and now I take the solemn determination
that I will clear up this mystery if it takes me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the rest of my life! I'll never be content till
I know the explanation of it all. And, Margaret,
I want you, if you will, to make a copy
of the journal for me&mdash;not the cipher, but the
plain English&mdash;so that I can refer to it whenever
I want. Will you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I will!" agreed Margaret. "We'll
all help you in every way we can. And here's
something else I've decided on. I'm going to
change your office in this Antiquarian Club,
Corinne, from just plain secretary to Chief Investigator!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="small">INTRODUCING ALEXANDER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Antiquarian Club continued to meet
two or three times a week, but for some
time the meetings were not enlivened with any
further discoveries. Corinne grew quieter and
more uncommunicative, Margaret restless and
discontented. And as for the twins, now that
the excitement had subsided and nothing
further on that order appeared to be forthcoming,
they became frankly bored with the proceedings
of their society and were claimed once
more by their basket-ball and tennis-playing
companions.</p>

<p>Several afternoons Corinne went alone to the
Charlton Street house and sat long with Margaret,
going over and over the old account-book
story. For neither of them did interest
in the matter ever wane. And even though
they appeared to have reached an insurmountable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
barrier, it did not utterly discourage them.
The mystery was always there, and the unsolved
riddle proved a constant lure.</p>

<p>Then one day Corinne came in, accompanied
by the twins, and all seemed in rather high
spirits.</p>

<p>"What's the news?" demanded Margaret at
once. "Have you discovered something, Corinne?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. And while it may not be of
any <i>great</i> help, at least it's another link in the
chain."</p>

<p>The twins, once more condescending to interest
themselves in the affair, exclaimed:
"Do tell us about it! We cut a basket-ball
match to come home this afternoon!"</p>

<p>"Well, as I said, it isn't much, but it's something.
Yesterday I was up at the Forty-second
Street Library, browsing around among
the old reference-books on New York City history,
when I suddenly came across this. You
remember, several times Alison spoke about
the housekeeper, 'Mistress Phœbe'? Well,
I've found out who <i>she</i> is!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>"You have!" they chorused.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I guess it's positive, for two books
mention it. She was Phœbe Fraunces, the
daughter of Sam Fraunces who kept the famous
'Fraunces' Tavern.' The building, by
the way, is still in existence down on Pearl and
Broad Streets. It has been restored to look
just the way it used to, and is the headquarters
of the Sons of the Revolution. Sam Fraunces
was a fine man and a great admirer of Washington&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Alison said so!" interposed Margaret,
half under breath.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and he was afterward the household steward
for Washington when he lived in New
York as President. One book says Phœbe
played quite a part in the plot&mdash;preventing it,
that is! That's all I found out, but it's interesting."</p>

<p>"It certainly is!" assented Bess, after a moment's
thought, "and it's just one more proof
that we're on the right track. But still I don't
see that it helps very much in finding out what
became of Alison, or anything about her!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it doesn't!" agreed Corinne ruefully.
"And that's just where it's so disappointing.
But there's this about it. In a puzzle like
this, every little bit helps along. Sometimes,
what really doesn't seem to amount to anything
at all, leads at last to the most important
discovery. For instance, that song&mdash;'The
Lass of Richmond Hill.' <i>That</i> didn't impress
us so much when we came across it, yet
it really led to all the discoveries we've made.
I propose that this afternoon we go over the
whole thing again, just as carefully as we can,
and see if there isn't some little clue that we
<i>may</i> have constantly overlooked. Of course,
I've done that by myself dozens of times, and
so has Margaret. But four heads are better
than one! Who knows but <i>this</i> time we may
light on the very thing?"</p>

<p>She was so hopeful and enthusiastic about it
that they all settled down to the work, reading
over the old diary very slowly and discussing
every point that seemed to offer the least suggestion
of a clue. They had reached the entry
which announced Washington's arrival, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
were hotly debating the question whether or
not Madame Mortier could be concerned in
the plot against him, when suddenly they were
electrified by hearing the loud crow of a rooster,
coming apparently from the darkness at
the far end of the room. (They had been talking
and reading by the light of the open fire
only.) Every one jumped, and Margaret
caught her hand to her heart. But Bess instantly
recovered herself, darted across the
room, dived behind the curtains, and returned
dragging into the circle a grinning, giggling
small boy.</p>

<p>"It's Alexander, of course!" was her brief
remark. Her captive was certainly an extraordinary-looking
youngster! Wiry, and
undersized for his age (he was thirteen), he
possessed a snub-nose, a shock of brilliant red
hair, and a quantity of freckles that literally
"snowed under" his grinning countenance.
His appearance was rendered all the more remarkable
by the fact that he had cut a series
of holes in an old, round, soft hat, and his brilliant
hair stuck straight up through these in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
astonishing red bunches. Not one whit did
he seem to resent the publicity into which his
recent exploit had brought him! Rather did
he appear to glory in the situation.</p>

<p>"Aren't you ashamed to be eavesdropping
behind the curtains?" demanded Bess, shaking
him by his collar, of which she still retained her
hold.</p>

<p>Alexander straightened himself and made
this cryptic reply:</p>

<p>"I don't get yer! But if yer mean piking
off this chinning contest,&mdash;no, I ain't!"</p>

<p>At the foregoing remarkable explosion of
slang, Corinne suddenly went off into a peal of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, Alexander, you're <i>rich</i>!" she exclaimed.
"I'm glad to make your acquaintance.
Teach me some of that, will you!"</p>

<p>The boy turned to her with an appreciative
and understanding twinkle in his eye: "Sure
thing! I'll put you wise, any old time!"</p>

<p>But Jess suddenly broke into this exchange
of amenities. "Do you girls realize what has
happened? Alexander Corwin has been listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
to all the proceedings of our secret society,
and now he knows just as much as we
do! Oh, I could <i>scalp</i> you!" she ended, making
a sudden dart at her cousin, who, though
still in the grasp of Bess, ducked and evaded
her. There had been unceasing warfare between
Alexander and the twins ever since he
came to reside with them. He teased them unmercifully,
and they sought frantically, and
always in vain, to retaliate. There seemed
nothing they could devise that affected him in
the slightest. This, the most recent outrage,
constituted to them, therefore, the last straw!
Suddenly Margaret intervened:</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! Maybe Alec wasn't <i>really</i>
trying to overhear what we said. Perhaps he
only meant to give us a scare. How about it,
Alec?"</p>

<p>"You got the right dope!" affirmed the
young rascal. "D'ye think I'd waste my valuable
time listening to the chatter of a lot of
Sadies? Nix on that! I just crept in there
to give the glad whoop and raise you out of
your chairs!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>Alexander never teased Margaret. Her
pathetic confinement to her invalid-chair appealed
to his rowdy little soul, and between
them there had always been an unspoken compact
of peace.</p>

<p>"But how much <i>did</i> you hear?" reiterated
Jess.</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't help getting wise to
<i>some</i>!" admitted Alexander wickedly, conscious
that this same admission was gall and
wormwood to the souls of the twins. "Heard
a lot of stuff about finding a book in our attic,
and George Washington, and a swell guy
called Madame something-or-other and some
kind of a dinky sapphire thing, and a kid called
Alison. Say! she must have been <i>some</i> girl!
But, gosh!&mdash;you needn't think I <i>wanted</i> to
hear it! I was only waiting for the chance to
give you the merry ha-ha!"</p>

<p>Dismay fell once more on the circle. Bess
had now released him, and he stood upright,
jammed his hands in his pockets, and grinned
on them with a curious mixture of triumph,
defiance, and pure impishness. It was Corinne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
who became suddenly inspired with a
brilliant idea.</p>

<p>"Look here, girls! I vote that we make
Alexander a member of the club! What do
you say?"</p>

<p>"Gee! I don't <i>want</i> to be!" exclaimed the
boy in a panic, making a sudden dive to escape.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you would, if you knew all about
it! Wouldn't he, Margaret? It's just the
kind of thing a boy would go crazy about.
There's so much <i>adventure</i> in it!"</p>

<p>At the word "adventure," Alexander
pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"What's a lot of <i>girls</i> got to do with adventures?"
he inquired skeptically.</p>

<p>"Just wait till you hear!" declared Corinne,
and Margaret seconded her with:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, Alec, you'll just go wild over
this! And it ought to have a boy in it, too!
Oughtn't it, girls?" But the twins remained
obdurate. To allow their declared enemy to
share their most cherished secret seemed to
them the height of madness. But while Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
was reasoning with Alexander, Corinne
whispered to them:</p>

<p>"You'd better do it, I tell you! He knows
too much already, and you don't know but what
he might give the whole thing away to Sarah
sometime!" And this final argument brought
them speedily round to her point of view.</p>

<p>"All right!" they agreed. "Alexander, you
can become a member of our secret society if
you want to, and Corinne will tell you all about
it."</p>

<p>And Alexander, his curiosity now thoroughly
aroused, offered no further objection to
the honor thus thrust upon him.</p>

<p>Corinne undertook to explain the whole matter
to him, showed him their discovery, explained
how they had deciphered the code, and
then proceeded to read him the translation.
His pat, slangy comments on it often moved
her to laughter, and when it came to the mention
of the song, he immediately wanted to hear
it, for&mdash;it was Alexander's chief merit&mdash;he
loved music with the appreciation of a born
musician. It happened that among the books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Corinne had brought Margaret was the collection
of old songs, containing the one in question.
She hunted this up now, and, going to
the piano, played it over for him, while he stood
at her side whistling the air.</p>

<p>"Say, I like that!" he commented when she
had finished. "That's a great old tune! The
words are a back-number of course, but they
go with it fine!" He hummed it over again.</p>

<p>"Isn't it queer!" exclaimed Corinne.
"Alexander is the only one who has exhibited
the least interest in learning or even <i>hearing</i>
that song!"</p>

<p>After this intermission, the story proceeded,
the boy growing more and more absorbed with
every word. But when it came to the disclosure
that Richmond Hill had stood just
about where they were now sitting, he leaped to
his feet with a whoop.</p>

<p>"Say! Wouldn't that jolt you! Gee! I
didn't have any hunch that you girls had a
thing like <i>this</i> up your sleeve!" Then, with
snapping eyes, he settled down to hear the remainder
of the tale. When Corinne had finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
he sat cross-legged before the fire for
several minutes, chewing meditatively the cap
he had riddled with air-holes.</p>

<p>So long was he silent, that Margaret exclaimed,
finally: "Well?" Then he got up,
stretched his legs, and inquired: "When you
going to have the next meeting of this joint?"</p>

<p>"The day after to-morrow," answered Margaret,
who was disappointed that after all he
did not seem to have any interested comments
to make. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," he answered in his remarkable
jargon of slang, "you can ring me in on the
fest, and&mdash;I <i>may</i> have a new piece of dope!"</p>

<p>When the meaning of this remark had
dawned on them, they all demanded eagerly:
"What? What? Can't you tell us, Alec?"</p>

<p>"Nothing doing&mdash;till the day after to-morrow!"
he called back as he made a hasty exit
down the hall.</p>

<p>And after his departure they all agreed that
they had possibly done a rather good day's
work in admitting the rowdy Alexander to the
Antiquarian Club!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="small">ALEXANDER TAKES HOLD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Two</span> afternoons later all the girls were
gathered in the parlor promptly at three,
but Alexander had not yet put in an appearance.
He attended the public school, which
did not dismiss as early as high school, and he
would probably be at least three quarters of an
hour late, as he was usually kept in for misbehavior.
During his absence, the girls discussed
him eagerly.</p>

<p>"Do you know," vouchsafed Corinne, "I
think he is the <i>cleverest</i> little rascal, and so
comical that I want to laugh whenever I look
at him! How is it I've never seen him before?"</p>

<p>"Why, the explanation is," answered Bess,
"that he never stays in the house afternoons if
he can possibly help it. He's always out running
the streets or playing baseball in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
vacant lots. But the other day it was cold and
damp, and Sarah discovered that he had a bad
sore throat and insisted that he stay indoors.
He's rather afraid of Sarah, though he does
tease her frightfully. That's why he was
around trying hard to annoy us&mdash;he hadn't
anything else to do!"</p>

<p>"Well, he's a little trump, anyway!" insisted
Corinne. "And did you ever hear such a glorious
collection of slang!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it <i>awful</i>!" sighed Margaret.
"Mother is terribly worried about him and the
way he talks. And yet she can't help laughing,
herself, sometimes, at the funny things he
says. Really, he often seems to be speaking in
some foreign language that I can't understand
a word of!"</p>

<p>"What does he mean by 'dope,' anyway?"
mused Corinne. "I can't imagine, unless it's
'news' or 'information.' You just have to <i>construe</i>
his remarks, as you do the Latin! I
think we'll have to get a dictionary of slang
if he keeps on like this!"</p>

<p>"But, oh, what <i>do</i> you suppose he is finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
out!" exclaimed Margaret. "What can he
possibly know that can have anything to do
with our secret?"</p>

<p>"You never can tell!" said Bess. "He goes
snooping around this neighborhood in all sorts
of places, and talks with all sorts of people.
Perhaps he <i>has</i> stumbled on something, though
I have my doubts. But here he comes now!"</p>

<p>Alexander entered the house, slamming the
basement door and singing at the top of his
high sweet voice:</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"On Richmond Hill there lived a lass,</div>
<div class="i0">More bright than May-day morn!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>After a preliminary scuffle and dispute with
Sarah in the kitchen, probably over the question
of cake, he came galloping upstairs, and
burst in upon them with a military salute and:</p>

<p>"Hullo, pals! Do I have to give the high
sign and the grand salaam?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that!" laughed Corinne.
"Hurry up and tell us about this wonderful
thing you know. We're crazy to hear!"</p>

<p>Alexander was visibly flattered, and drew a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
chair to the group by the fire, with an air of
great importance.</p>

<p>"Well, it's this way," he began. "It hit me
all of a sudden the other day, that I had the
dope on something that might be right in your
line o' goods. But I wasn't sure, and I
wanted to nail it. Now I <i>have</i> nailed it&mdash;and
it's O.K.!"</p>

<p>"Tell us, quick! Quick!" cried Margaret.</p>

<p>"Hey! put on the brakes a minute, kid!"
he commented. "If you go so fast, you'll bust
your speedometer! Do you know where McCorkle's
stable is?"</p>

<p>All but Corinne nodded. For her enlightenment,
he explained: "It's around on
Varick Street between Charlton and Van Dam,
on this side of the way."</p>

<p>"It's a funny old place, isn't it!" interrupted
Margaret. "Sarah sometimes wheels
me past it. The building looks awfully ramshackly.
But what about it? Surely it can't
have anything to do with <i>our</i> affair!"</p>

<p>"Just you douse your sparker and save gasoline!"
chuckled Alexander. "Shows how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
much <i>you</i> know about things! You <i>needed</i> a
man on this job! As I was going to say, I
know Tim Garrity pretty well&mdash;he has charge
of the horses. We're pretty good pals, and he
gives me a whole lot of interesting dope, off
and on. Last summer he told me something
that stuck in my crop, but I didn't think of it
again till the other day. Then I thought I'd
go and nail it for certain, before I told you
kids, and I got him to reel it off again yesterday.
It's the dope, all right! I saw it myself!"</p>

<p>"For gracious sake, Alexander, don't keep
us in suspense another minute!" implored Corinne.
"Tell us quick!"</p>

<p>"All right! Now I'm going to shoot!
You remember telling me about the theater
that old house was turned into? Well, Tim
once told me that the stable was built right over
where an old theater had stood,&mdash;on the very
foundations,&mdash;and in the back, where the stalls
are, you could see a part of the old stage, the
paintings on the beams, and frescoes&mdash;he called
'em! He was quite proud of it!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>The listening four were now sitting up
straight and tense. He went on:</p>

<p>"I didn't pay much 'tention to it at the time.
Didn't interest me! Rather be talking about
baseball! But the other day, after all you told
me, I fell for it again. Yesterday I went
round and made him tell me all over again and
show it to me, too. I guess we've hit the trail,
kids! It was there, all right! Funny old gilt
do-dabs, and you could just make out the shape
of the stage, curved, the way they have 'em in
the theaters now."</p>

<p>He stopped, and every one drew a long
breath.</p>

<p>"Alexander, you are certainly a trump!"
sighed Corinne. "This is the best discovery
yet. But I'm surprised that the site of the
house should be on Varick Street. Most books
said it faced on Charlton."</p>

<p>And Bess added her say:</p>

<p>"This is certainly awfully interesting, but
I'm blest if I can see how it's going to be of
the slightest <i>help</i>!"</p>

<p>"Say, you're what us baseball fans call a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
bonehead," and Alexander chuckled derisively.
"I'll bet Corinne's fallen for it already, without
being told!"</p>

<p>"I confess, I don't see <i>just</i> how it helps," admitted
Corinne, "unless&mdash;unless&mdash;there's some
part of the old, original house left."</p>

<p>"That's the line o' talk!" shouted the boy,
triumphantly. "I knew you'd hit the bull's-eye
if any one did! There sure <i>is</i> something
of the old house left, and that is&mdash;the <i>beams</i>
that supported the cellar ceiling! They make
the foundation of the stage!"</p>

<p>This time Alexander certainly scored a sensation.</p>

<p>"The beams&mdash;<i>the beams</i>!" cried Margaret.</p>

<p>"Then there must be the one that had the
secret hiding-place in it!"</p>

<p>"Now you're talking!" remarked Alexander.</p>

<p>"But did you <i>see</i> it? Can you get <i>at</i> it?"
demanded Corinne.</p>

<p>"There's where Central cuts you off! I examined
the thing carefully, and got Tim to tell
me all he knew. But we found that the stable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
only went part of the way through the old
cellar of the house; the two ends are cut off and
underground&mdash;or at least they're behind the
side walls of the stable. Can you beat it?"</p>

<p>"Then we can't get at it after all!" wailed
Margaret, disappointed all the more keenly for
the high hope that had been raised.</p>

<p>"Nope! We just can't get at it&mdash;as things
stand now!"</p>

<p>"Isn't there <i>any</i> way you can think of,
Alexander?" demanded Corinne. "Think
what we might find in that secret nook&mdash;gold,
jewels, papers of great value,&mdash;oh! this is exasperating!
Can't you think of <i>some</i> way?"</p>

<p>Alexander, however, only appeared to lapse
into deep reverie.</p>

<p>"I haven't showed you my whole line o'
goods yet!" he confessed, after submitting
them to an interval of soul-satisfying suspense.</p>

<p>"You haven't&mdash;what?" echoed Corinne uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Told you&mdash;all&mdash;I know!" he translated
obligingly.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, for goodness' sake, go on! How you
do tease!"</p>

<p>"Here it is: in a few weeks they're goin' to
begin to widen Varick Street and put a subway
through."</p>

<p>They only gazed at him, after this statement,
in uncomprehending bewilderment.</p>

<p>"You don't get me yet?" he went on.
"Well, that means they're going to do a good
deal of altering."</p>

<p>Still they appeared unenlightened.</p>

<p>"Gee! but you four are <i>thick</i>!" he cried at
last. "The only way they can widen it is by
tearing down all the houses on one side. And
that's just what they're going to do on <i>this</i>
side! McCorkle's stable has got to go. Now
are you on?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;" stuttered Corinne.</p>

<p>"<i>Then</i> we can get at the secret beam!" announced
Alexander in triumph.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="small">ALEXANDER SPRINGS A SURPRISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was with impatience indescribable that the
members of the Antiquarian Club awaited
the demolition of McCorkle's stable. Now
that Alexander had enlightened them as to the
approaching changes in Varick Street, the girls
watched with absorbing interest the slow,
gradual approach of the house-wrecking
throng which had sometime before invaded the
upper portion of the street. For weeks they
had been passing unheeded the frenzied scene
of tearing down, digging up, and general destruction
that had suddenly changed peaceful
Varick Street into an unsightly heap of ruin
and scaffolding. It had meant nothing to
them, so absorbed were they in their own affairs.
And now they found, quite to their
amazement, that it was going to have a very
direct bearing on these same affairs!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>House by house, block by block, it drew
nearer. Every day that was pleasant enough
for Margaret to be out she commanded Sarah
to wheel her past the work of demolition, much
to Sarah's disgust, who infinitely preferred the
quiet, sunny, unobstructed walks of peaceful
Charlton Street. Then, before turning the
corner homeward, Margaret would beg to be
wheeled past McCorkle's stable, at which she
would gaze hard and rapturously as long as it
was in sight. This also deeply annoyed and
bewildered Sarah.</p>

<p>"Bedad!" she would exclaim impatiently, "it
does beat me what ye see in that dur-rty owld
rookery! 'Tis fit only fur th' scrap-heap, and
ye look at it as if it was hung wid diamonds!
What's got into ye these days, Margie macushla!
'Tis that quare Corinne gur-rl that
has bewitched ye!"</p>

<p>Margaret could easily see that Sarah was
very, very jealous of her new friend, so she
would say nothing, but only smile her slow,
mysterious little smile. "That queer Corinne
girl" had indeed bewitched her, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
brought into her pain-ridden, colorless existence
something worth living for! But this, of
course, she could not admit to Sarah.</p>

<p>At last, one cold, blustery afternoon, the
twins burst in with the exciting information
that the house-wrecking had actually commenced
on their own block, up at the King
Street corner. After that the interest became
concentrated and intense. And by the time
the little old dormer-windowed shanty on their
own corner was leveled to the ground, they had
reached the tiptoe of excitement.</p>

<p>Fully two weeks before this McCorkle's
stable had been vacated and left ready for its
destruction. And since then Alexander had
spent much time crawling around its foundations
and examining it in every nook and
cranny.</p>

<p>When the little building next to it came
down, and the day before the stable was to
have its turn, the Antiquarian Club held an
important meeting, called at the request of
Alexander.</p>

<p>"This is going to be ticklish business!" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
announced; "getting at that beam, I mean.
And I ain't so sure it's going to pan out all
right, either. Good thing to-morrow's Saturday,
so I can be on the job all day. But
I've been laying my pipes pretty slick! I've
got on the soft side of a lot of those workmen,
and the night-watchman loves me as if I was
his little nephew Willie! It's the night-watchman
I'm depending on most. He's
agreed to let me in there to grub around any
night I want&mdash;so long as I don't do any
damage. But, see here, you kids! Don't be
setting your hopes on me getting at anything
to-morrow, 'cause more'n likely they won't
touch the foundation before next week!"</p>

<p>The next day saw the demolition of McCorkle's
stable. It being Saturday, the Antiquarian
Club was able to be present in full
force (on the opposite side of the street) to
see it go. Margaret's chair was wheeled by
the twins and Corinne in turn. But Alexander,
across the street in the danger-zone,
gyrated, imp-like, up and down the sidewalk
and was twenty times ousted from imminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
peril by the half-indignant, half-laughing
workmen.</p>

<p>Piece by piece the boards and bricks fell,
story by story the old building came down, till
at last it was level with the very sidewalk, and
carts began to remove the debris. Then was
visible the strange thing that Alexander had
long before told them about.</p>

<p>"See! see!" he cried, running across to them
and pointing back excitedly. "There it is!
Didn't I tell you so?" And looking toward
the back, they could plainly discern the queer,
curved outline of the old stage, with a few
cracked and tarnished bits of gilt cornice still
clinging to it.</p>

<p>"But when are they going to reach the beams
underneath?" demanded Margaret, in an excited
whisper.</p>

<p>"Not before Monday! At least, they can't
get to uncovering the ones <i>we</i> want before
then. The rest are almost bare now."</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>how</i> can we wait till Monday!" wailed
Margaret.</p>

<p>"I gave you the tip we might have to!" admonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Alexander. "You're entirely too
light and speedy! You ought to go into the
house-wrecking business yourself&mdash;then you'd
see!"</p>

<p>The interval between Saturday and Monday
seemed simply interminable to every one of the
five. On Sunday, Alexander spent much time
haunting the ruins, Corinne was obliged to be
in her own home, Mrs. Bronson was visiting a
sick friend, and Margaret and the twins, left
alone, whispered together most of the day
about the impending event.</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you suppose we'll find in that
beam?" Margaret would inquire for the hundredth
time.</p>

<p>"Probably nothing!" Bess would reply, for
she was always inclined to look on the dark side
of things.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's not <i>possible</i>!" Margaret would
retort. "<i>I</i> think it may be some important
papers. I don't expect there'll be gold, or
jewels, or anything of that kind. But just
suppose it was the <i>sapphire signet</i>!"</p>

<p>"Do you know, dear," said Jess, once, "I'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
be pretty well satisfied if we even found just
the <i>hole</i>! That would show, at least, that
Alison's account was correct, and we had
worked things out right, so far."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it wouldn't help us out any with
solving the mystery," objected Margaret.
"When do you suppose it will be get-at-able,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"Alexander says he's going to be there before
school in the morning, and again at noon,
and in the afternoon too. He says he's almost
tempted to play hookey and be there all
day! But I told him Sarah and Mother would
have a fit if he did! The club is to be all together
here in the afternoon, and he'll come
right in and tell us the minute he discovers anything."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be simply awful," moaned
Margaret, "if any one got in ahead of us and
looted the place in the beam!"</p>

<p>"Alexander doesn't think that likely," declared
Jess. "I asked him about that, too, but
he says it's probably so well concealed that nobody
would think of such a thing&mdash;unless the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142&ndash;144</a></span>
beam were to be chopped up, and that won't
happen for a good while yet."</p>

<p>So they were all forced to possess their souls
in patience till Monday afternoon. Then,
with fast-beating hearts, the girls gathered in
the Charlton Street parlor. Alexander, of
course, was not with them, and they did not
expect him for some time. But, to their utter
amazement, he strolled in about three-thirty,
hands in his pockets, whistling "The Lass of
Richmond Hill" as unconcernedly as though
this were not the day of days for the Antiquarian
Club!</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Alexander, what's wrong?"
demanded Corinne.</p>

<p>"Wrong? Nothing at all! Everything O.
K., A., number one!" he replied airily.</p>

<p>"But why aren't you over at the stable as
you said you'd be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't think it worth while!" he answered
indifferently, ambling over to gaze out
of the window.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_143.jpg" alt="Poked around" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small">"I poked around it, top, bottom, and sides"</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"But, Alec!" cried Margaret. "Have you
gone back on us like this? And after all you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
said! And you seemed so interested, too! I
just can't believe it of you!" Her great, beautiful
gray eyes filled with sudden tears, and
Alexander, turning from the window, observed
it.</p>

<p>"Aw! turn off the weeps!" he exclaimed
gruffly, but contritely. "Can't you all take a
bit of kidding? It <i>ain't</i> worth while for me to
be over there any more&mdash;because I've found
the beam already&mdash;and explored it!"</p>

<p>At this astonishing revelation they sprang
upon him literally in a body&mdash;all but Margaret.</p>

<p>"Oh, Alec! You <i>didn't</i>! When? Tell
us all about it? What did you find? How
did you do it?" The questions rained thick
and fast.</p>

<p>"Well, just unhand me, and sit down, and
I'll tell you all about it! Saturday night I
was crawling round a bit after the work was
all over, and only the night-watchman there.
I found that the two beams on this north end
were really pretty well uncovered, in spots,
and what was left over them could be easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
scraped off. It was mostly dirt and loose
mortar. I didn't have time to do anything
that night, but I gave the watchman the tip
that I'd be back the next night and poke
around a bit. He likes me, and he thinks I'm
collecting wood to build an Indian wigwam in
that vacant lot on Hudson Street. And us
fellows <i>are</i> building one, too, so it's no lie!"
Alexander, to do him justice, was scrupulously
truthful.</p>

<p>"So I beat it out, last night, after borrowing
the twins' door-key, so I wouldn't have to
wake up that lallypaloozer, Sarah, when I
came in. Of course I took a chance of not
striking the right beam,&mdash;it might be the one
at the south end, for all I knew. However, I
doped out the one I thought it was, shoveled
off the bricks and mortar softly, so's not to
attract attention, and measured off ten feet
from the <i>west</i> end with a tape-line. You know
the kid, Alison, said the steward stood about
ten feet from the wall of the house, along the
beam.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I opened my big-bladed pocket-knife
and poked and poked and poked around it, top,
bottom, and sides. But never a sign of an
opening did I find. After I'd been at the job
about an hour, I gave it up and scooted for the
<i>east</i> end of the beam, and began the same thing
all over. Nothing doing for about half an
hour! Then all at once, my blade slipped into
a crack! I gave a hard pull, and&mdash;jumping
Jupiter!&mdash;there I was! The thing came open
like a door on a rusty hinge, and there was a
hole about a foot and a half long!</p>

<p>"You bet I didn't do a thing but shove my
hand in and feel all around in the hole! I
didn't dare even to light a match, for fear a
cop might see me. Just then, all of a sudden,
the watchman called out softly that the roundsman
was coming and I'd better beat it while the
going was good! I just had time to duck off
that beam, crawl along the darkest side of the
wall, and sneak out as the roundsman came
along and stood talking to the watchman, as
he always does, for about fifteen minutes. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
got into the house all hunky,&mdash;and that's why
it ain't any use for me to be there this afternoon!"
he ended abruptly.</p>

<p>"But, Alec, what did you <i>find</i>? Did you
find <i>anything</i>?" demanded the four in one
breath.</p>

<p>Alexander nodded impressively. "Yep! I
found something all right!" Then he suddenly
took an object from under his coat and
laid it carefully in Margaret's lap.</p>

<p>"I found <i>this</i>!"</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="small">THE MYSTERY UNRAVELS FURTHER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> would be useless to attempt describing the
mingled sensations with which the Antiquarian
Club (all but Alexander) bent to examine
the latest "find." The twins, however,
drew back in a moment with a disappointed air
and the disgusted query:</p>

<p>"Is <i>that</i> all! What in the world is it?"</p>

<p>It certainly was neither gold nor jewels, nor,
apparently, important papers of any sort, and
their interest waned at once. It <i>was</i> paper of
some kind&mdash;dirty, mildewed, stained with time,
and nibbled freely by mice. But it bore no resemblance
to the state documents, laden perhaps
with impressive seals, that the twins had
vaguely expected to behold, if, indeed, the find
took that shape at all. But Margaret and
Corinne had been turning it over carefully.
All of a sudden they uttered a simultaneous
little cry:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, girls! Don't you know what it is?"</p>

<p>"No!" declared the twins.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;<i>the other half of the diary</i>!"</p>

<p>Then indeed did the twins give way to belated
exultation in which Alexander joined, for
of course he had already discovered this.</p>

<p>"Yes, it certainly is!" reasserted Corinne,
examining it more closely. "The book was
evidently torn in two, and this half concealed
in the beam,&mdash;but for what earthly reason I
can't imagine! I wonder if Alison put it there
herself?"</p>

<p>"D'ye see anything queer about the first
page?" inquired Alexander, mysteriously.
They bent again to examine it. The first page
was the most worn and stained and torn and
least decipherable of all, because it had been
unprotected. There were the same characters
of the cipher, only very dimly discernible.
But written diagonally across it, evidently
with something black and dull, possibly a piece
of charcoal or charred wood, were a few words
in English. They were so faint that they
might have been taken merely for the traces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
of dark stains or smudges had not one examined
them closely.</p>

<p>"Shall I put you wise to what they say?"
suggested Alexander.</p>

<p>"Oh, do!" they all cried.</p>

<p>"Well, here it is: 'I am now assured you are
a spy. This proves it. I can make naught of
it, but will hide it securely. Later I will denounce
you.' Wouldn't that jar you, now!"</p>

<p>"Who <i>do</i> you suppose wrote it?" demanded
Corinne.</p>

<p>"Could it have been Alison?" suggested
Margaret. "Maybe she meant it about the
steward."</p>

<p>"That's <i>my</i> guess!" echoed Alexander.</p>

<p>"But why did she write it in English, and
with this charcoal or whatever it is? And why
did she hide it in that beam? And why was the
diary torn in two?"</p>

<p>"You can search me!" Alexander remarked,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out by
translating the rest?" quietly suggested Bess,
the practical. "No doubt she'll say something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
in it that will put us on the right track."</p>

<p>"Good business!" chuckled Alexander.
"You've got some <i>sense</i> in that bean of yours,
kid!"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you!" retorted Bess,
coldly. She thoroughly disapproved of his
slang, and was never amused by it as the rest
often were.</p>

<p>"I should worry!" he responded unconcernedly,
and turned to Margaret. "Couldn't
you dope out a bit of it now, kiddie? You've
got the goods to do it with."</p>

<p>"No," interrupted Corinne, looking at her
watch; "it's getting late, and I must go.
Let's give Margaret a couple of days to work
it out, and then we'll have a grand old meeting
and solve the whole riddle&mdash;I hope!"</p>

<p>Much as they longed to know the whole story
at once, it was obvious that Corinne's suggestion
was most sensible. But before they separated,
they unanimously voted "Aye!" to
another matter&mdash;that the discovery of the contents
of the secret beam was the most satisfactory
thing that had happened so far!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later they gathered around Margaret,
keen for the exciting revelations that
they felt sure were awaiting them. Margaret
had resumed her sphinxlike attitude of mystery
and would reveal no clue to what she had discovered.
When they were settled and quiet,
Alexander remarked:</p>

<p>"Go ahead, kid! Shoot! Get it off your
mind!" And smiling indulgently on him,
Margaret began:</p>

<p>"You remember where we left off in the
other half of the journal&mdash;a sentence just
stopped in the middle. It was this:&mdash;'For
Madame M. will accept naught from him
and&mdash;' Now, on this first page, she completes
it. And, by the way, I had the <i>worst</i> time
puzzling out that first page! It was so stained
and faded and torn. Sometimes I wasn't even
sure I was getting it right. But I guess now
I have it correct. She goes on to finish:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"&mdash;yet I scarce could tell him so. He must have
guessed my predicament, for he only smiled and said
it was of no moment. An she would not care for it,
I might keep it for myself. 'Twas rarely kind in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
him. I long to tell him about myself, but I dare not&mdash;not
yet.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Then comes a break. Now she says:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"His lady did pass me to-day, walking in the garden;
and since the high shrubbery screened us, I
curtesied deeply to her. I scarce dare notice her
when any of the household are by. She looked at me
long, then spoke me fair, asking had she not met me
before she came here. I answered, yes, the day her
coach broke down on the road last year, and I helped
to hold the frightened horses while 'twas mended.
She did thank me anew, and asked me what it was I
was about to tell her then, when Madame M. had
dragged me suddenly away. I replied that I dared
not repeat it there, but would seek some chance to
speak with her alone when we did have more time and
were not observed. Then I heard footsteps approaching,
and I fled quickly away."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Wonder what it could have been that she
was trying so hard to tell Lady Washington!"
sighed Corinne. "This doesn't grow any <i>less</i>
mysterious, apparently! Go on, Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Another break, then she says:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"I have at last learned what is this wicked plot&mdash;"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Good business!" ejaculated Alexander.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>"'Tis through Mistress Phœbe I found it out.
She has a lover who is one of <i>his</i> life-guard, and this
lover she has had cause to suspect is not entirely loyal
to <i>him</i>. Last night she did ply him with overmuch
good malt brew, and in his befogged state she did
get him to babble the secret. Oh, it is a vile scheme!
They are planning to deliver the city out of <i>his</i> hands.
But that is not the worst. They seek first of all to
murder <i>him</i>, and in some underhand, cowardly fashion.
The manner of it is not decided yet. Phœbe
tells me her lover will remember no word of what he
said to her last night in his cups. But she intends
to watch him right closely. When she has learned
the manner of the plotted murder, <i>he</i> must be
warned."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Isn't this exciting!" exclaimed Corinne.</p>

<p>"Bully! Hot stuff!" agreed Alexander.</p>

<p>Margaret continued: "Now, another entry.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"I have confided my story to Phœbe. She is well
to be trusted, I feel. She has promised to help me in
my need. I am becoming right fond of Phœbe. Corbie
was here last night to see the steward. They are
both in the plot, we feel sure. After Corbie left, the
steward descended to the cellar. I did not dare to
follow&mdash;I could only guess that he went to his secret
hiding-place.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Now another space. Then:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Phœbe had news to-day. Last night she did again
muddle her lover with much strong drink. And she
did get him to confess that the plot is near completion;
that if all goes well, 'twill be put in action four
days from now. He also did acknowledge that they
intended to put him out of the way by poisoning
something he ate. But he knew nothing more definite.
Phœbe says she dares not thus befuddle him again.
It is too dangerous, as he has shown that he suspects
he is babbling and has asked her since many searching
questions, to which she pretends guileless ignorance.
We must watch him. What if we should not
be able to foil him and his vile conspirators!</p>

<p>"Madame M.'s health does not improve. Nay, she
has dropped so low that 'tis feared she will not live.
Her physician did bleed her yesterday, but 'twas of
no avail. She recognizes me, but she will have naught
to say to me. In fact she is too weak to utter a word.
I am right sorry for her and grieve that she cannot
forgive me, though I have done no real wrong. I have
sometimes thought she must know of the plot, the vile
plot that is to be enacted in this house. But Phœbe
declares she is innocent of that. Deep as her hatred
may be, she would never wink at such a crime."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Well, that settles <i>one</i> question, anyhow!"
interrupted Corinne. "Do you remember how
we discussed that?"</p>

<p>"Yep! that was the day I butted in!" commented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Alexander, in whimsical recollection.
"Fire away, kid!"</p>

<p>Margaret continued:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Phœbe and I do despair of discovering by what
means they plan to carry out the plot. She dares no
longer question her lover when he is under the influence
of wine. Nor does she yet dare denounce him,
lest the other conspirators escape unharmed. It
would be premature to do so till we know the exact
facts. I have told her of the steward and his secret
hiding-place in the wine-cellar. If we can do naught
else, we will rifle that some time when he is away.
Perchance there may be information in it.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Then, here's the next entry:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"It is midnight, and on the morrow the plot will be
consummated. I write this in much fear. Perchance
it will be the last I shall ever have opportunity to
write. If such be the case, and my relations in Bermuda
do ever find this trunk and the diary in its false
bottom, and should they be able to decipher it, I want
them to know that I, Alison Trenham,&mdash;"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"<i>Trenham!</i>" shouted the listening group.
"Hurrah! at <i>last</i> we know her full name!
That's dandy!" Margaret gave them little
heed and went on:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p>"&mdash;do grievously repent my folly in ever leaving my
peaceful home; that I beg Grandfather to forgive me
if he can, and wish Aunt and Betty to know that I
love them always. Also, that H. and his uncle were
little to blame for their part in what happened before
we left Bermuda, and that I do not regret giving my
assistance, for it was a noble cause, even though our
government did not approve.</p>

<p>"To-night, Phœbe and I did raid the steward's
secret hiding-place. We waited till he had gone out,
about ten o'clock, and from his actions we made sure
that he would be away long, for he went straight to
Corbie's tavern. But even so, we took a terrible risk.
Once in the cellar, our work was not difficult. I
pointed out the location of the spot, and we opened
the beam as I had seen him do. But our amazement
was great when we found naught in it. He must have
removed every belonging, and that right recently.
We were just about to turn away when Phœbe declared
she would look once more, and she felt all about
in it carefully. Her search was rewarded, for far
back in a crevice was stuck a small folded note.</p>

<p>"We read it by the light of the candle, not at first
daring to take it away. It was from the governor,
and said that on the morrow a dose of poison should
be put into a dish of peas prepared for <i>him</i> at his
noonday meal. The poison would have no effect under
an hour. In the meantime, word should go forth,
and the fortifications would be seized. Everything
was in readiness. That was all. The note had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
plainly been forgotten by the steward when he removed
his other papers. We dared to keep it, on a
second thought, since he would probably think he had
lost it elsewhere, if he missed it at all. So we took
it away with us.</p>

<p>"Our plans are all laid. Phœbe will herself be in
the kitchen to-morrow at noon, and no doubt either
her lover or the steward will place the poison in the
dish. Then I am to pass through the kitchen at a
certain moment, and Phœbe will request me to carry
in the dish and lay it before <i>him</i>. As I do so, I can
whisper <i>him</i> a warning not to eat of it, saying I will
explain later. If Phœbe herself did this, she would
be suspected at once, for she never goes into the dining-room
to serve. But she will choose a moment
when no retainer of his happens to be in the kitchen,
and send me with it instead. God grant that the
plans do not go wrong. <i>He</i> will suffer, and our own
lives will be in great danger should we fail or be discovered.</p>

<p>"We have arranged that, when I go to him later
to disclose what we know, I shall also tell him my own
story and throw myself on the protection of him and
his good lady. For I fear it will then be no longer
safe for me to remain here as I am now. That is all.
God has us in His hands. I await the morrow with
untold trembling.</p>

<p>"Should it be thought strange that in writing this
journal I have given few <i>names</i> and so made the
identities hard to guess, I must explain that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
ever been in great fear of this being discovered&mdash;nay,
even deciphered. I bethought me that the fewer
names I used, the less incriminating this might be
to myself and all concerned. As I read it over now,
I feel that it was but a poor makeshift, at best.
However that may be, I trust that it may some day
get back to my dear ones in Bermuda, should aught
evil befall me. <i>They</i> will understand.</p>

<p>"The hour grows late and I must retire, though I
feel little able to sleep. But one thing more I must
disclose ere I bring this journal to an end,&mdash;the hiding-place
of the sapphire signet. Should it befall
that I never return to my home nor see my relatives
again, it would be only right that they be informed
where the jewel may be found, and that I meant no
evil in taking it from Grandfather. Also, I do earnestly
beseech any soul who shall perchance sometime
long in the future find and decipher this record, that
he or she will search for the signet in the place that I
have indicated. And should they find it still there
hidden, I pray that they will make an effort to return
it to any of my family or connections who may still
exist.</p>

<p>"I have concealed the sapphire signet in&mdash;"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Margaret came to a dead stop. "Girls&mdash;and
Alexander&mdash;that's absolutely <i>all</i> there
is!"</p>

<p>So tense had been the interest that they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
not believe their ears when Margaret made
this announcement. Alexander was the first
to recover his power of speech. Thumping
the floor indignantly, he delivered himself
thus:</p>

<p>"Suffering cats! <i>Can</i> you beat it!"</p>




<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="small">ALEXANDER ENGAGES IN SOME HISTORICAL<br /> RESEARCH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> the chorus of surprise and bewilderment
and indignation had at last
subsided, they fell to discussing in its every
detail this new phase of the journal and its
abrupt ending.</p>

<p>"I tell you," announced Alexander, thumping
a sofa-cushion to emphasize his remark,
"something <i>happened</i> to that kid just as she
got to the last,&mdash;something happened, sure as
wash-day! And it wasn't anything pleasant,
either! Do you get me?"</p>

<p>"You must be right!" agreed Corinne.
"When you think of what <i>was</i> going to happen
the next day, and the danger she was in,
and the fact that this journal is torn in two,
and all that, I'm positive something terrible
must have taken place just then. Poor little
Alison! How are we <i>ever</i> going to know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
it was, or whether she ever got out of it all
right and got back home! If the end of the
other half of the journal was maddening, this
is about forty-five times worse! I feel as if
I'd go absolutely <i>crazy</i> if this mystery isn't
cleared up!"</p>

<p>"There's one thing you must remember,"
suggested the practical Bess. "History tells
us that the poison plot was discovered in time
and didn't do Washington any harm; and that
Phœbe Fraunces gave him the warning, and
he just cleared up the whole thing, and hanged
the worst one of the conspirators,&mdash;whoever he
might be! Now, if that's the case, don't you
think we could take it for granted that Alison's
affairs turned out all right, too?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily!" retorted Corinne. "Remember,
also, that Washington didn't know
anything about her, and that that horrid
steward had been watching her and plotting
about her; and so had Corbie, too. Who
knows but what they took her and carried her
off before the thing was to take place, in order
to have her out of the way!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>"And there's another thing," added Margaret.
"Do you remember what I told you
Mother said about that trunk of hers? It was
found floating around in an old wreck. Now
how did it get there? If there was a wreck and
she was on it, she was probably drowned and
never got back to Bermuda alive. But how
did she come to be on a vessel with her trunk
if she had been captured by the steward? Did
he put her there?"</p>

<p>"Maybe she wasn't on that vessel at all!"
was the contribution Jess made to the problem.
"Somebody else may have taken possession of
her trunk for all you can tell. A trunk is
something <i>anybody</i> can use!"</p>

<p>"But did you ever hear of such a maddening
thing as that journal breaking off just the
minute she was going to tell where she'd
hidden the signet!" exclaimed Corinne in thorough
exasperation. "Why couldn't it have
gone on just a second longer&mdash;at least till she'd
had time for a tiny hint! And, see here! Do
you realize that she was actually talking to <i>us</i>
(though she didn't know it) when she begs the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
person who finds and deciphers this journal in
the future to find the signet and return it to
her people?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's <i>so</i>!" cried Margaret in a tone
of hushed awe. "It didn't strike me at first.
She's actually speaking to <i>us</i>&mdash;for we <i>must</i> be
the first ones who have read this journal!
Isn't it amazing!"</p>

<p>"You don't know whether we are or not,"
contradicted Bess, with her usual cold common
sense. "Lots of people may have seen it before
we did, and found the signet, too."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's likely," argued Corinne,
coming to Margaret's defense. "And besides,
how could they find the signet when she didn't
even have a chance to tell where it was! No, I
feel quite sure we're the first; but how are we
ever going to know where she hid it? And
even if we <i>did</i> know, would we be able to find
it after the changes that have come in all these
years?"</p>

<p>"Then too," put in Jess, "there's a chance
that Alison got out of the trouble all right,
anyhow, and took the signet back to her grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
herself. How are you going to tell?"</p>

<p>"There's one thing you all seem to have forgotten,"
suggested Alexander. "And it's the
biggest boost of the whole outfit! We are wise
to her last name&mdash;<i>Trenham</i>. Now you, Corinne,&mdash;you've
been down there to that little
old joint, Bermuda. Did you ever hear of any
one by the name of Trenham?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. Of course, I never inquired
particularly, not knowing anything about this,
then. But I never heard that name. There's
a very common one on the island that's a good
deal like it&mdash;Trimmingham&mdash;but that doesn't
help much. It probably isn't the same,
though the English do have the funniest way
of shortening their names and pronouncing
them in queer ways!"</p>

<p>"Wrong trail!" exclaimed Alexander,
briefly. Then, suddenly turning to Margaret,
he added:</p>

<p>"Here, kiddie! Hand me that journal-thing
you've doped out. I want to give it the
once-over!" He studied it thoughtfully for
several minutes, tugging viciously the while at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
a long lock of red hair that always hung over
his eyes. The rest all kept very quiet, watching
him expectantly. Presently he issued his
ultimatum:</p>

<p>"There's one other piece of business that
you all seem to have pretty well given the cold
shoulder&mdash;this song and dance about some plot
in Bermuda that the Alison kid says she was
mixed up in. Have you ever thought of doping
that out?"</p>

<p>"No, we haven't," admitted Corinne. "I
did think once of hunting it up, but the whole
thing was so awfully vague that there didn't
seem to be any use. What could you hunt up,
anyway? You'd have to read up a lot of Bermuda
history, and even then you probably
wouldn't strike a thing that had any bearing
on it!"</p>

<p>"You never can tell!" remarked the boy,
wisely. "Me for this job, from now on!
Where's that library joint you get all your
books from, Corinne? Little Alexander's
going to join the army of high-brows!"</p>

<p>"You can take my card and use it, Alexander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
or I'll get you the books myself," Corinne
kindly offered.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, but nothing doing!" he
returned. "This kid gets right on the job himself
when he strikes the trail. All I want to
know is how you break into the place. If you
put me wise to <i>that</i>, yours truly will do the
rest!"</p>


<p class="p2t">In the course of the next few days, Alexander
became a duly enrolled member of the
nearest public library, and his family was
edified to behold him deeply immersed in the
most unusual occupation of literary and historical
research. As he ordinarily touched no
volume of any nature except his school-books
(and these only under severe compulsion!), the
spectacle was all the more amazing. Baseball
and other absorbing occupations of his street
life were temporarily forgotten. He would
lie for hours flat on his stomach on the couch,
his heels in the air, pushing back his rebellious
lock of hair, and mulling over the various odd
volumes he had brought home from the library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
At intervals he could be heard ejaculating:
"Gee!" "Hot stuff!" and remarks of a similar
nature.</p>

<p>But of his discoveries, if indeed he had made
any, he would have nothing to say, conceding
only that, when he had found anything of interest,
a meeting of the Antiquarian Club
should be called, and he would then make his
disclosures in proper business form. This was
absolutely all they could draw from him. The
twins reported to Corinne at school that Alexander
was certainly doing (for him!) a remarkable
amount of reading; and it was not all
about Bermuda, either, as they had discovered
from the titles of his books. American history
also figured in his list, and other volumes whose
bearing on the subject they could not even
guess. They also expressed their wonder at
the curious change they had noticed in his manner
toward them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Alexander's <i>all right</i>!" Corinne assured
them. "You've always misjudged that
little fellow, girls! He's got heaps of good
in him! Of course, he's a little rough and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
slangy, and a terrible tease, but most boys <i>are</i>,
at his age; and some are lots worse. He's a
gentleman at heart, though. You can tell that
by the way he treats Margaret. He's always
just as gentle with her! But you've never
taken him right. You get awfully annoyed
when he teases you, and that's just exactly
what he wants; it tickles him to pieces to see
you get mad! If you'd only take him up
good-naturedly and give him as good as he
gives you, you'd find yourselves getting along
heaps better!"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what you do, I guess!" remarked
Bess, ruefully. "And I can see that
he thinks you're fine. He said the other night
that you were 'some good sport,' and that's
praise&mdash;from him! I'm going to try and act
differently toward him from now on. But, oh!
his language is so dreadful and slangy! It
irritates me to pieces, and I just can't help
snapping at him when he talks that way!"</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Corinne, "I've noticed
a queer thing about him. When he's very
much in earnest and forgets himself completely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
especially in this mystery business, he
hardly uses any slang at all,&mdash;just talks like
any one else! I believe he'll grow out of all
that, later, when he's learned that it isn't the
way the worth-while people talk. But he's
bright&mdash;bright as a steel trap; and think where
we should have been in this affair if it hadn't
been for him!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all unconscious that he was a
subject of such animated discussion, Alexander
was pursuing his researches in grim earnest;
and at length, in the course of a week or so,
he announced that a meeting might be called
and he would make his report. When they
had gathered expectantly the following afternoon,
he came in with an armful of books and
settled down on the floor before the open fire.</p>

<p>"Now, don't go boosting your hopes sky-high!"
he remarked, noting the tense expectancy
of their attitudes. "I ain't doped out
anything so very wonderful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>haven't</i> you, Alexander?" exclaimed
Margaret, disappointedly. "I thought you
must have found something <i>great</i>, the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
you've been grunting and chuckling and talking
to yourself all this time when you read in
the evenings!"</p>

<p>"Sorry to give you the cold shower, kiddie!
I've done the best I could; and if I was chuckling
and grunting, it was because I'd struck
some ripping hot stuff in the way of adventures.
Say! that Bermuda history is <i>some</i>
little jig-time! I started to wade through it,
thinking it'd be as dry as tinder, and you can
knock me down with a plate of pancakes, but
it was rich! Started right in with the greatest
old shipwreck, when old Admiral Somers and
his men got chucked off on this uninhabited
island! Gee! it was as good as 'Robinson
Crusoe,' that we're reading about in school.
Then they had a rip-snorting old mutiny, and
started in to build another ship, and all that
sort of thing! And later on, after they'd gone
home to England and come back and settled in
a colony there, they started up some witchcraft,
and ducked a lot of gabby dames and hung
some more, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Alexander," interrupted the impatient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Margaret, "you can tell us all about that some
other time. What <i>I</i> want to know is, did you
find out <i>anything</i> that seemed to be connected
with our mystery?"</p>

<p>"That's right, kid! We'll get down to
business, and do our spieling afterward.
Well, I didn't strike a blooming thing that
seemed to be even a forty-second cousin to our
affairs till I got down to the year 1775; and
then I hit the trail of a piker called Governor
Bruère, who was the reigning high Mogul in
Bermuda just then. He was some pill, too,
you can take it from me! And everybody
seemed to hate him like poison, he was such a
grouch. Well, it was just about the time when
the Revolution busted out in the U. S. Washington
was up there around Boston, keeping
the British on the jump. But he was scared
stiff, because gunpowder was so short. There
were only about nine rounds left for each
American soldier. But they were chucking a
good bluff, and of course the British weren't
wise to it.</p>

<p>"Just about then, somebody put Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
on to the fact that down in Bermuda there
was a whole mint of gunpowder concealed
somewhere in the government grounds, and it
wouldn't be so hard to get hold of it. At the
same time, too, the Bermudians were pretty
nearly starving, because they got all their food
supplies from America, and since the war
broke out, England had cut them off at the
meter. So Washington doped it out that here
was a good chance to make an exchange. He
sent a couple of fellers to tell the Bermudians
that, if they'd give him that powder, he'd send
them a whole outfit of eats. And you'll admit
that was square enough!</p>

<p>"But wouldn't this jar you! When they
got there, they found the whole place up in
the air and the governor sizzling around like a
cannon-cracker, because some one had got in
ahead of them, stole the powder, and carted it
off to America! They just turned tail and
beat it for home and mother as quick as they
could, before the governor got wind of their
business! So long as Washington got the
powder, they should worry!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>"But the how of it was like this: a fellow
named Captain Ord,&mdash;or some say it was one
called George Tucker, but most think it was
Ord,&mdash;had it all fixed up with some Bermudian
friends that he should get the powder on the
q. t., load it on board his ship, and beat it while
the going was good. The powder-magazine
was in the government grounds at a dump
called St. George's, and Governor Bruère always
slept with the keys under his pillow.
Well, some smooth guy managed to swipe
those keys one dark night, and they rolled
down no end of barrels to a place called
Tobacco Rocks, loaded 'em on whale-boats,
and rowed out with 'em to the ship that was
anchored off Mangrove Bay, wherever that
may be, and Captain Ord was off with it before
morning. Well, you can take it from me that,
when Bruère got wise to what had happened,
he went up in the air! He was a hot sketch,
and he made it warm for the Bermudians; but
it didn't do any good, as nobody knew much
about the business&mdash;or if they did, they
wouldn't tell!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyhow, Washington got his powder, and
it's on record that afterward he sent a heap of
swell eats down to pay for it! Gee! wouldn't
I like to have been in on that fun though&mdash;the
night they swiped the loot!"</p>

<p>"But, Alexander, I don't see what all this
has got to do with Alison!" cried Margaret.
"There's nothing in it about a girl, or the least
thing that concerns her!"</p>

<p>"That's just where I knew you'd throw me
down!" remarked Alexander. "I told you to
begin with that I hadn't found anything positive
about it, didn't I? Well, this is the <i>only
thing</i> that even passed it on the other side of
the gangway! That Alison kid keeps talking
about a plot in Bermuda and something that
happened that the government didn't cotton
to, and there isn't another blooming hook to
hang your hat on but that, unless it's something
that isn't spoken of or known about in
history. Then there's one other reason. She
speaks of some one called H., and his uncle,
and his uncle's ship, and how they were afraid
to go back to Bermuda because one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
sailors had turned piker and given way on
them. Of course, it's all guesswork! And
what in thunder a kid like Alison could have
to do with such a piece of work, beats me!
But there you are! I'm done!"</p>

<p>There was considerable disappointment in
the Antiquarian Club, when Alexander had
ceased, that nothing more definite had been unearthed
by him. It seemed highly unlikely to
them all that this strange little historical incident
could have any bearing on the affairs of
the mysterious "lass" whose secret they had
stumbled upon. None but himself appeared
to put any faith in the connection between the
two, and they discussed it for a time hotly. At
last Corinne, perceiving that Alexander was
becoming piqued that his efforts were not more
appreciated, declared:</p>

<p>"I think you've done splendidly, Alec, in
discovering anything at all, among such a lot
of uncertain stuff; and perhaps we'll come
across something later that will make us sure.
But you seem to have been reading quite a pile
of books. Are they all about Bermuda?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>"Nope! Not on your tintype! There are
precious few about Bermuda alone, anyway.
So after I'd chewed up what there was, I took
to doping out American history, and I came
across some hot stuff there, too! The main
guy over there in the library advised me to read
Washington Irving's 'Life of George Washington'
when I told her I was tracking down
American history. And say, that's going
some, too&mdash;in spots! I fell over something
last night that'll make you all put on the glad
smile&mdash;I found out the name of the feller that
was soft on Phœbe!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it?" they shouted in a satisfying
chorus.</p>

<p>"Thomas Hickey!" announced Alexander,
proudly.</p>

<p>"But how do you know?"</p>

<p>"'Cause that's the name of the feller Washington
hung! It was a member of his life-guard
who was one of the conspirators!"</p>

<p>"Alexander, you're <i>some</i> trump!" declared
Corinne. "In all my browsing, I never came
across <i>that</i>!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="small">A BELATED DISCOVERY AND A SOLEMN <br />CONCLAVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">During</span> the month following Alexander's
researches into history, no further
progress was made in solving the mystery
that absorbed the Antiquarian Club. The
Christmas holidays came and went, and the
severer winter weather held the city in such a
grip that often, for days on a stretch, Margaret
could not be wheeled out in her chair.
Under the combined strain of confinement to
the house and lack of any further stimulating
excitement, she grew very restless and just a
wee bit unhappy. The girls and Alexander
were very busy with their midwinter examinations,
and could not give much time to other
interests, even such absorbing ones as the long-ago
Alison and her fate.</p>

<p>But, with the beginning of February, matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
improved. The weather moderated, to
begin with, the sun shone daily, and Margaret
could again enjoy her outing of an hour in the
sunny part of each early afternoon. The
others also, released from the grind of much
study and "cramming for exams," had leisure
at last to give to the club-meetings, which they
now held regularly three times a week. Alexander
was not always with them, for the claims
of hockey and skating and coasting often
proved too much for his boyish soul to resist.
But, for the most part, he managed to be on
hand at least once a week, for his interest in
the mystery was still very great.</p>

<p>They grew into the habit of reporting, at
these meetings, any even slight discoveries they
had happened to make, in their reading or in
any other manner, that had the slightest
bearing on the subject. Thus, Corinne contributed
the following, that she had gleaned in
looking over a history of New York City: in
referring to Abraham Mortier, some one had
once remarked that the expression "Laugh
and grow fat!" did not apply to him, since, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
he was very jolly, he was so thin that
the wind could blow him away!</p>

<p>"That's interesting, but of course it doesn't
help <i>us</i> much!" Corinne added apologetically.
"But I thought anything about the
Mortiers would be well to know. I'll warrant
Madame Mortier was just the opposite&mdash;very
fat and solemn!"</p>

<p>Alexander contributed the information that
Thomas Hickey was hanged at a spot about
where the corner of Grand Street and the Bowery
is now. And so deep was his interest in
this gruesome affair that he even made an excursion
across the city one afternoon to visit the
site!</p>

<p>Margaret found a description of Richmond
Hill, written by Mrs. John Adams during her
residence there, in which she described at much
length the beauty and attractiveness of the
spot. Only the twins, who read but little,
made no additions to the stock of information.
This they apologized for by saying that they
were no hand at such things, and about everything
had been discovered already, anyhow!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>Then Corinne invented another form of entertainment.
This was that each member of
the Antiquarian Club should, after due thought
and consideration, invent an explanation of his
or her own for the curious break in Alison's
journal and her probable fate. The game
proved an exceedingly diverting one, and every
member took a separate meeting and expounded
the particular solution that appealed
to his or her imagination.</p>

<p>Corinne herself wove a romantic tale about
Alison's having been captured that very night
by the steward and Corbie while she was writing,
how they carried her off, journal and all,
and later fought over her book and tore it in
two; how Alison was rescued by the mysterious
"H." just in the nick of time, and was
taken away to Bermuda to marry him and live
happily ever after! But the mystery of the
two halves of the journal and their strange
hiding-places and the whereabouts of the sapphire
signet she admitted she couldn't explain
and didn't try to!</p>

<p>Alexander invented a lurid tale of Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Hickey discovering Alison in the act of writing
her journal, tearing it in two in snatching it
from her, and retaining the latter half. Phœbe
then helped Alison to escape with her trunk
and the other half and embark on some vessel
that was later overhauled by pirates and scuttled,
and Alison was made to "walk the plank"!
This horrible ending so affected Margaret that
she cried herself almost sick over it. And Alexander
thereat was so conscience-stricken that
he determined henceforth to keep his inventive
powers under better control.</p>

<p>Margaret herself advanced the theory that,
for some reason, Alison and Phœbe suddenly
determined to tear the journal in two and each
keep half of it as evidence in case anything
should go amiss. That Phœbe hid her half in
the beam, and Alison put hers in the trunk.
Then they went and denounced the plot to
Washington, and he was so grateful that he
sent Alison right home to Bermuda, where she
lived happily, having taken the signet with her,
and giving away the trunk to some relative and
forgetting all about the journal in the bottom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
It was the relative who was shipwrecked and
abandoned the trunk!</p>

<p>Again the twins, who had no gift of imagination,
refused to offer any solution, though they
were highly interested in the tales of the others.
They both declared that they could think of
absolutely no explanation, so what was the use
of their trying? And on these grounds the
others excused them. So the month passed,
and then one day Margaret announced that
she herself had made a discovery, and proceeded
to tell of it.</p>

<p>"It all came about through Sarah wanting
to wheel me over through Macdougal Street
to-day and down Spring Street, because she
had an important errand there. You know
we <i>never</i> go through Macdougal Street, because
it's so narrow and not nearly as nice
and clean and sunny as our own and Varick
Street. I actually don't think I've been over
that way for three or four years! Well, just
as we were passing a house between this block
and Van Dam, I looked up at it, and what do
you think I saw?&mdash;the brass sign near the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
door&mdash;"Richmond Hill House"! I couldn't
imagine for a moment what it meant. But I
asked Sarah if she knew what the place was,
and she said it was a settlement-house, with
a day-nursery and clubs for the children and
things like that in it.</p>

<p>"I asked why it was called that name, and
she said she didn't know&mdash;thought it was a
silly one and didn't mean anything. But <i>I</i>
knew&mdash;though I didn't say so! Somebody
who knows about history has called it that because
it stands almost on the grounds where
Richmond Hill used to be. But oh, girls!
think how much trouble and wondering and
hunting it would have saved us, if we'd only
known about that house at first! It would
have suggested the thing to us right away!"</p>

<p>"Huh!" remarked Alexander, disgustedly.
"<i>I</i> knew about that old joint right along&mdash;ever
since I lived here! <i>I</i> could have told you a
thing or two, if you'd only consulted yours
truly sooner!"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind!" said Corinne, soothingly.
"Maybe we <i>did</i> get at things in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
roundabout, clumsy fashion; but we got there,
just the same, and we had a good time doing it,
too! But now I've something brand-new to
say, and I want you all to listen very attentively.
This is a matter that needs a lot of
careful consideration. We've about come to
the end of our rope, as far as making any
further progress with this mystery is concerned.
We've been having a lot of fun and
entertainment out of it, of course, with these
stories of our own, and all that sort of thing.
But we're not 'getting any forrarder,' as
Dickens says; and do you know, I'm beginning
to think that perhaps we're not doing
just right in keeping this all to ourselves!"</p>

<p>Here Margaret started and gave her a reproachful
look. Corinne put an arm over the
invalid girl's shoulder and continued:</p>

<p>"Honey dear, I know you think I'm playing
the traitor, and trying to spoil our delightful
secret society, but I'm really not; and if
you'll hear me to the end, I believe you'll feel
the same as I do. I've been doing a lot of
hard thinking about this matter lately. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
you haven't realized it, but I am certain
that this old journal we've found is really a
very valuable thing&mdash;not only valuable in the
way of money (for many people would pay a
great deal for a genuine old document like
this), but also in the way of historical information.
We're keeping to ourselves something
that might really throw light on the past
history of our city.</p>

<p>"Now, of course, I'm not <i>certain</i> about this,
but I'd like to have the opinion of some grown
person who really knows. And I've thought
of a plan by which we could do this, and at the
same time keep our secret society <i>almost</i> the
same as it is now. It's this: I would like you
all&mdash;and especially Margaret&mdash;to consent to
my telling my father all about this, and, if he is
willing (and I'm certain he will be), we can
let him become a member of our Antiquarian
Club. In that way, you see, we won't be
breaking up our society&mdash;we will just be adding
another member!"</p>

<p>"But he's a <i>grown</i> person!" objected Margaret,
trying hard to keep the tears from rising.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
"And he wouldn't care a <i>bit</i> about a
thing like this! And we'd feel so strange and&mdash;and
awkward to have an older person in it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but you don't <i>know</i> my father!"
laughed Corinne. "To be sure, he's a <i>grown</i>
person, but I never met any one who was more
like a <i>boy</i> in his manner and interests and sympathies!
Why, he's actually more <i>boyish</i>
than lots of the young fellows in high school.
He is deeply interested in young folks and
their affairs; and if he weren't such an awfully
busy man, he'd spend most of his time being
with them. He and I are <i>such</i> chums! You
ought to see us together when he's away on a
vacation! He romps around with me as though
he were only sixteen, and everything that interests
me just absorbs him too. I believe you've
thought, because I said he loved books and history
and <i>old</i> things, that he's a regular old
fogey that goes around stoop-shouldered and
spectacled! He isn't a bit like that!"</p>

<p>"I got you, Steve!" ejaculated Alexander.
"He must be <i>some</i> good sport! I vote we ring
him in on this!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret, however, still looked only half
convinced.</p>

<p>"But, if he's so busy," she ventured, "I
don't see how he's ever going to find time to
attend these meetings&mdash;even if he wanted to!"</p>

<p>"Of course," Corinne responded, "it would
be impossible for him to get to our meetings,
as a rule, but I know that he would be glad to
hear all about them from me, and sometimes,
on holidays, he'd be delighted to just get together
with us all. And, what's more, I know
he'd always have some interesting thing that
he'd propose doing&mdash;something probably that
we've never thought of!"</p>

<p>Margaret had, by this time, almost completely
melted, but she had one further objection
to offer:</p>

<p>"But, Corinne, he doesn't <i>know</i> us&mdash;not a
thing about us, and he'd feel awfully strange
and queer too, getting acquainted with a lot of
brand-new young folks he's never even heard
of before!"</p>

<p>And again Corinne had her answer, even
for this.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"Wrong again, Honey!" she laughed.
"Talk about his not <i>knowing anything</i> about
you! Well, do you suppose for one wild
minute that I've never told him about these
loveliest friends I ever had? Why, every
evening he and I talk for at least a couple of
hours about every blessed thing that interests
us. I've given him your whole history, described
you all in every detail, told him how
much I come here, and that we had an important
secret society. The only thing I <i>haven't</i>
told him is the secret! But I've done something
else that I hope you won't mind&mdash;I've
let him know that I was very anxious to have
him admitted as a member, and that the secret
was something he'd probably find <i>very</i> interesting.
And, do you know, he's just crazy
to be allowed in it, and is only waiting for the
time when I'll come home some day bringing
him the high permission of its dear president!"</p>

<p>Then, at last, did Margaret capitulate.
How, indeed, could she hold out after having
been presented with such an alluring picture
of the latest member-to-be! Truth to tell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the desire was awakened in her heart to meet
this delightful father, who was so young in
spirit that his daughter considered him a
"chum"! She gave her full consent that he
was to be told everything that night, and Corinne
departed in high feather. When she had
gone, Margaret turned to the rest.</p>

<p>"It must be lovely," she sighed, "to have a
father like that!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="small">SARAH TAKES A HAND IN THE GAME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Corinne</span> came rushing home with the
girls next day. Margaret, who rather
expected her, had been waiting in considerable
impatience, and not a little secret dread, for
her arrival.</p>

<p>"Girls," she panted, throwing aside her
wraps, "it's all right! I had the loveliest time
telling Father all about it last night! You've
no idea how perfectly <i>absorbed</i> he was in the
story! He was like a boy listening to a pirate
yarn! I read him all the translation of the
journal that Margaret made me, and he was
just about wild when it came to the end so
abruptly. He thought, with me, that it was
best not to take the original from here, because
you never can tell what accident might happen
to it, carrying it around, but he says he ought
to see it at once.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>"And, do you know, he said we'd done very
clever work indeed, in puzzling out what we
had of this mystery all by ourselves! I was
so proud! And he said, also, that Alexander
deserves special credit for the work he did in
finding the secret beam. It isn't every boy
who would have had such a good idea. He
says Alexander is going to make a bright man,
and a prosperous one, too, some day! Where
is that youngster, by the way? I want to tell
him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, he hasn't come in yet!" exclaimed
Margaret, hastily returning to the main subject.
"But tell us, Corinne, what else did your
father say?"</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't half told you yet! To begin
with, he says that we have really stumbled
on something very valuable indeed&mdash;just as I
told you! This journal ought to make one of
the most interesting additions to the curiosities
of history that have come to light in many a
long day. And he says he shouldn't wonder
but what it would be very valuable from the
money side, too. There are people and institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
that will pay hundreds and hundreds
of dollars for rare manuscripts like that, if
they're genuine! And there's no doubt but
that this is genuine, all right! And he says
we <i>may</i> be able to think out where the signet
was hidden, too.</p>

<p>"But, first of all, he wants very much to see
the journal, and, of course, he must come here
for that. He wanted to come and call on your
mother some afternoon very soon. But I told
him that was not possible, because your mother
is away at business all day, and anyway, your
mother wasn't a member of the club, and perhaps
you wouldn't want to explain the whole
thing to her just yet. So he said he would
telephone to her to ask if he might stop in here
with me some afternoon; and he called her up
this morning about it. She said she would be
very glad to have her girls meet the father of
such a dear friend of theirs. Wasn't that
lovely of her? If you all are agreeable, he's
coming day after to-morrow, because he happens
to have that afternoon free. He will
meet the twins and myself at high school, walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
down with us, and be initiated into the Antiquarian
Club. He says that being shown that
wonderful journal ought to constitute a sufficient
initiation ceremony, and I agreed with
him! Now, what do you say?"</p>

<p>Margaret agreed unhesitatingly, yet in her
secret soul she was filled with just the same
consternation that she always felt in being
called upon to meet a stranger. But she tried
to school herself to the ordeal by reminding
herself how easy it had been to make the
acquaintance of Corinne. The father of so
lovely and wonderful a girl ought surely to
be no more difficult to meet. Corinne had
brought light and pleasure and manifold interest
into her drab little existence. Might
not the father do the same? Thus she argued
with herself as the time slipped by, till at
length the day itself dawned that was to bring
a new factor into her life.</p>

<p>"Wheel my chair over to the bookcase,
please, Sarah!" she commanded that afternoon,
when she had been made ready to receive
company in the parlor. "I'll read, I guess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
till the girls come. Corinne may bring her
father to-day, so could you have something
kind of nice to eat, Sarah dear?" The woman
gave her an odd look.</p>

<p>"Always that Corinne!" she grunted jealously.
"Ye be fair daffy over that gur-rl, I
do believe! An' now her father's comin' wid
her! Why is she bringin' him? I ain't got
refreshments fur the likes of them!" She
muttered and growled herself out of the parlor,
but her remarks gave Margaret no uneasiness.
Too well she knew that, though Sarah
might fuss and fume over some imagined imposition,
she would ascend later with the
daintiest of trays and serve the same maligned
company with food fit for the gods! So Margaret
contentedly settled herself to wait and
pass the time by giving the curious old journal
one further inspection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the day's session at high school
came to an end, and, at the gate, Corinne and
the twins found Mr. Cameron awaiting them.
Whatever mental picture the twins may have
had of Corinne's father, they found it very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
little like the reality. At once they were captivated
by his twinkling blue eyes, his crisply
curling, slightly gray hair, his friendly smile,
and the thoroughly charming way he had of
crinkling up his eyes when he laughed. They
liked, too, his big, deep voice, his fine, tall,
athletic-looking frame (and they wondered
how he could be ill so often, when he <i>looked</i> so
robust), and the jolly way he had of laughing
at his own or other people's remarks. No
longer did they wonder at his being such a
chum of his daughter's, for before they had
gone three blocks, he had become as interested
in their accounts of basket-ball as though that
game were the chief occupation of his existence.</p>

<p>But it was when he came to talking of their
wonderful mystery that he showed to his best
advantage, in their eyes. Alexander himself
could not have exhibited a more thrilling interest
in the whole affair than did Mr. Cameron.
And as they proceeded down Varick
Street, he branched off into talking of other
historical associations connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
neighborhood; told the most fascinating little
anecdotes, pointed out hitherto unnoticed
nooks and corners of odd shape and architecture,
and explained the probable reasons for
their existence. So enthralling was his conversation
that they reached their own corner
almost before they noticed it. Just as they
turned down the street, however, they encountered
Alexander. After the renewed introduction,
Mr. Cameron voted that they all
have a look at the former site of McCorkle's
stable, and that Alexander should point out
the exact location of the secret beam, long since
removed to give place to iron subway-girders.</p>

<p>This naturally captured the heart of Alexander,
and before they returned to the house,
he was fairly ready to worship, in his boyish
manner, this remarkable specimen of a grown
man who seemed equally interested in baseball,
Indian wigwam-building, hockey, skating, and
boy affairs of all descriptions. But Alexander
would sooner have been torn limb from
limb than confess this worship to the girls!</p>

<p>At last they all approached the house, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
up the stoop, and waited while Bess opened the
door with her latch-key. The girls thought it
rather strange that Margaret was not sitting
in the window, waiting to wave to them as she
always did, but they concluded that she must
have had a fit of shyness, because of the new
visitor, and had remained behind the curtains.
In the hall they called gaily to her, and were
again a little surprised to hear no response.
Then they all entered the parlor.</p>

<p>To their utter astonishment they beheld
Margaret, huddled in her chair by the bookcase,
her eyes wide and frightened, her face
bearing plainly the marks of recent tears.</p>

<p>"What is it, Honey?" cried Corinne, the
first to spring forward. "Are you feeling
ill?"</p>

<p>"No," murmured Margaret, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>"Well, here's father!" went on Corinne.
"You must welcome the latest member of the
Antiquarian Club, Miss President! And
don't be afraid of him, for he knows you very
well!" Corinne said this in a tone of forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
gaiety, thinking that perhaps Margaret was
really frightened at the prospect of meeting a
stranger. Her father shook the little outstretched
hand cordially, said some pleasant
things of a general nature, and then plunged
at once into the important subject of the day.</p>

<p>"Now you must initiate me, Miss Margaret!
Show me this wonderful thing you clever
people have unearthed! I want to see it so
badly that I could hardly sleep last night with
expectation, and that's no exaggeration!
It's the real truth!"</p>

<p>To the utter astonishment of every one,
Margaret burst suddenly into wild tears.</p>

<p>"It's gone! It's gone!" she sobbed. "It
isn't there any more!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Honey?" cried Corinne,
rushing to her and trying vainly to hush
the child's hysterical weeping. "It can't be
gone! What's happened to it?"</p>

<p>At this the sobbing came with renewed violence,
and it was several minutes before Margaret
was able to whisper the one word:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Sarah!</i>"</p>

<p>"What about her? Do you want her to come
up?" inquired Bess. Margaret frantically
shook her head.</p>

<p>"Childie," said Corinne at last, very gently,
"try to calm yourself and tell us what has happened.
You'll be ill if you keep on like this!"</p>

<p>After a moment, Margaret straightened
herself, with a great effort stopped the sobbing,
and spoke:</p>

<p>"I know I'm a silly to act like this, but a
terrible thing has happened. <i>The journal is
gone!</i> I looked for it in its usual place this
afternoon, and&mdash;it wasn't there! I hadn't
taken it out for several days, and I knew the
rest of you hadn't either. I couldn't imagine
what had become of it, and I didn't like to ask
directly, of course. So I called Sarah up and
asked her if she'd been cleaning the bookcase,
because I missed something. She gave me
just one queer look. Then she said no, she
hadn't been cleaning, but if I was looking for
that old rubbish I kept back there, I needn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
look any more, because she'd taken it all out
and&mdash;<i>burned it up</i>!" Margaret sobbed afresh
at the memory.</p>

<p>"<i>Burned it up!</i>" shouted every one in a
chorus of consternation.</p>

<p>"But why under the sun should she <i>do</i> such
a thing?" demanded Corinne, indignantly.
"Even if it weren't valuable, it seems to me
simply cruel in her to destroy anything she
knew you were interested in and prized! I
can't understand it!"</p>

<p>"Did she say anything else?" asked Bess.</p>

<p>"No," added Margaret, "She just stalked
out of the room and downstairs. She seemed
awfully mad about something. And I was
so stunned I couldn't say a thing. But I just
sat and cried and cried till you all came in."</p>

<p>"This all seems very extraordinary!" began
Mr. Cameron. "And it is the more so to me,
because I have always understood Corinne to
say that Sarah was devoted to all of you, especially
to Miss Margaret. As Corinne suggests,
it would appear simply wanton cruelty
in her to deliberately destroy anything she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
knew her favorite prized. Maybe there is
something we haven't understood. Perhaps
the woman hasn't really burned the thing up&mdash;is
only trying to tease you. Would there
be any objection to our seeing her, and perhaps
putting a few questions?"</p>

<p>"None at all!" declared Bess, though she
secretly felt that there might be many. And
with some very uncomfortable qualms, she
rang the bell that Margaret always kept by her
side. In two minutes they heard the heavy
footsteps of Sarah on the basement stairs, and
in two more she had opened the parlor door
and stood before them.</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter?" she inquired as
her hostile glance swept the room and its occupants.
But they all noticed that her manner
lacked its usual assurance, and that she was decidedly
ill at ease.</p>

<p>"We were wondering if you could explain
what became of Miss Margaret's papers and
blank-books," began Mr. Cameron, constituting
himself spokesman. "She tells me you
have removed them. They are rather interesting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204&ndash;206</a></span>
and I had come to-day on purpose to
see them."</p>

<p>At this Sarah uncorked the vials of her
wrath.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption">

  </div>
</div>

<p>"Ye do well to be askin' afther them dur-rty
owld bits of paper filled so full wid ger-rms
they was probably fightin' to hang on! I told
her I'd bur-rned them up, an' I told the truth.
If she don't get the typhoid-new-mon-i-ay, it
won't be fur want of hangin' over them mouldy
rags day afther day! I been watchin' her, an'
don't ye fergit it! She ain't been well this
month past&mdash;ever fur her. I guess she ain't
told ye I'm up wid her the better part of every
night wid the pain in her back! Even the
docther don't know what's the matter wid her,
she's ailin' so much worse lately. I ain't
watched her all her life fur nuthin', an' I been
watchin' her closer than ever lately, though she
didn't guess it. I usually come up them
stairs like a rhinoceros-horse&mdash;I know that!
But I <i>can</i> come up pretty soft when I choose&mdash;an'
take the time! I seen her draggin' these
things out from behind the books, an' shovin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
'em back if she thought any one was comin',
an' breakin' her poor back bendin' over 'em,
studyin' 'em's though they wus made of gold!
An' I says to meself, this has got to stop! So
I jest took 'em out the other day an' burned up
the whole clamjamfray of 'em. An' ye kin
say what ye like about their bein' interestin',&mdash;I
don't believe it! The dur-rty, disgustin'
owld rubbish!" And with this final shot,
Sarah turned and tramped heavily out of the
room, leaving an astonished and speechless
group behind her.</p>

<p>The remaining time that Corinne and her
father were there was spent in comforting
Margaret. There was no denying that Sarah
had finally, definitely, and fatally ruined every
hope they had cherished of disclosing to the
world a new and startling historical discovery.
And Mr. Cameron was more bitterly disappointed
than he dared to show. But he tried
to cheer Margaret as best he could, and when
he came to go, he left her with this pleasant
consolation:</p>

<p>"Never mind about the original journal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
now. That's gone, and no good ever did come
of crying over spilt milk! Remember that the
mystery remains, just as good as ever it was,
and it is still the business of the Antiquarian
Club to solve it! I, the latest member, am
just as interested as the rest of you. <i>Some
day</i>&mdash;mark my words!&mdash;we're going to fit the
pieces of this puzzle together!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="small">THE SAPPHIRE SIGNET</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Margaret</span> was far from well, even
for her. For two weeks she had been
ailing, and appeared weak and listless. Corinne
was not very much surprised on coming
in one afternoon to find her no longer in her
wheel-chair by the parlor window, but upstairs
in bed in her room on the second floor.
This had never happened before since the day
that Corinne had first visited the little house in
Charlton Street, and her heart misgave her as
she climbed the stairs with the twins. But
she entered the room, assuming a cheerfulness
she was far from feeling.</p>

<p>"Taking a vacation in bed, Honey? Well,
I don't blame you, in such wretched weather!
It was sleeting and freezing as I came in, and
the walking is simply abominable. How cozy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
you are here with another open fire! You
seem to have one in every room. I wish <i>we</i>
did!"</p>

<p>Margaret greeted her with something of her
old animation, but presently relapsed into listlessness
again. Corinne chatted on for a time,
as though nothing out of the ordinary were the
matter:</p>

<p>"I've got some news from the latest member
of the Antiquarian Club! He has a proposition
to make. He says that when the first
nice spring weather comes, he's going to invite
the club to a series of 'antiquarian outings.'
They're to take place every pleasant
Saturday afternoon. He will have a big,
comfy automobile come here, and we're all to
pile in,&mdash;Margaret in the comfiest place of all,&mdash;and
we're going to 'do' old New York&mdash;the
real, historic parts, I mean. One day
we'll take a run up to Van Cortlandt Manor,
and see that place, which was Washington's
headquarters at one time. Then another day
we'll do the lower part of the city, and have
lunch at Fraunces' Tavern. And, oh! he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
planned a lot of things like that. It's going
to be great fun, I tell you!"</p>

<p>But Margaret failed to be roused to any
extent even by this delightful prospect, though
the twins were thoroughly enthusiastic. At
last, when Bess and Jess had gone downstairs
to investigate the refreshment proposition, Corinne
determined to fathom, if possible, the
curious apathy that seemed so new to Margaret.</p>

<p>"Honey, dear," she crooned, sitting on the
bed-side and putting her face down by Margaret,
"something's bothering you, and I want
you to tell me what it is! Something's
troubling your mind. Can't you tell me about
it, dear, even if you haven't any one else?"</p>

<p>Margaret raised herself on her elbow and
faced Corinne. "Yes, something <i>is</i> bothering
me," she acknowledged, "and no one but you
has seemed to notice it. But I'm going to
tell you, Corinne, because I love you, and I
haven't any secrets from you. I'm just worried
<i>sick</i> because that journal was destroyed!
It was my fault. I'm responsible for it all!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
It might have been very valuable, and been
sold for a good deal of money. And that
would have helped Mother a lot, because we're
not very well off, and she has to work awfully
hard!"</p>

<p>"But, Margaret," exclaimed Corinne, "this
is all nonsense! Of course, it's unfortunate
that the thing happened, but you can't even
blame Sarah, for <i>she</i> didn't know it was anything
of value, and she thought she was acting
for the best, and saving you from getting sick.
<i>Nobody's</i> to blame! It's just one of those
unlucky things that happen sometimes. It
isn't as if you or any one else had been <i>careless</i>
about it!"</p>

<p>"But you don't understand me!" insisted
Margaret. "It <i>was</i> my fault, because I kept
insisting that this thing should be a secret, and
nobody else was to be told. It was terribly
foolish&mdash;I can see that plainly now! And I
never should have kept such a valuable thing
in such an insecure place. We ought to have
shown it at once to your father and let him
keep it. Oh, I'll never forgive myself&mdash;never,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
never!" She turned her face into the
pillows and lay a long time silent,&mdash;not crying,
but just in an apathy of self-reproach.</p>

<p>Corinne, meanwhile, argued and pleaded
and consoled&mdash;in vain. Margaret would
neither look up nor respond. And at last, in
despair, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Margaret, I want to tell you something
Father said last night. It may make you feel
better about this very thing. He said that
even though the original journal was destroyed,
that didn't alter the fact that we
youngsters had made a most remarkable 'find,'
and had discovered a mystery that was well
worth tracking to its finish. He says he's
proud to be a member of the Antiquarian
Club, and hopes you haven't let any one else
into the secret. He wants it kept quiet till
we've fathomed the riddle, if we ever do!
You <i>haven't</i> told any one yet, have you?"</p>

<p>Margaret raised her head, at this, with a
faint spark of interest. "No, I haven't even
told Mother," she said, "because I hated to
have her know how near we'd been to finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
something valuable, and then disappointing
her by saying it was lost. Of course, we've
told her all about your father's visit, and
she thought he was so kind to take such an interest
in us. She said she supposed it was for
<i>your</i> sake. Sarah has never said another
word, even to me, about the things she burned
up. I think she's half ashamed of it, and yet
feels that she really did right in taking away
something that she supposed was hurting me.
She's awfully worried because I don't seem
so well, and she's almost killing herself taking
care of me and doing all her other work, too.
But, Corinne, did your father say he'd <i>really</i>
like this all kept a secret still? That's awfully
nice of him, and makes what <i>I</i> did seem
not quite so foolish! I believe I'll feel a little
better about it from now on!"</p>

<p>Margaret certainly appeared to improve in
spirits after this interview, but still her bodily
strength did not return, and day after day she
remained confined to her bed. Her mother
and Sarah grew almost ill themselves with
anxiety about her. The doctor said it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
drain of the winter on her frail system, and
prescribed a strong tonic, but even this did not
seem to have the desired effect. But Corinne
came in one day with news that actually
brought a tint of pale pink to the little invalid's
white cheeks.</p>

<p>"Father's been doing some tall <i>thinking</i>
lately," she announced, "and this is the result.
He wants me to submit the matter to the Antiquarian
Club for due consideration, and would
like every member present when I do so.
Where are the others?"</p>

<p>The twins and Alexander were promptly
gathered into Margaret's room, and Corinne
continued:</p>

<p>"This is what Father's been puzzling over.
He says that sapphire signet must have been a
very valuable thing, and it ought to be found,
if there's the slightest possibility of finding it.
He knows a lot about precious stones and their
history, and he says that a <i>sapphire</i> signet, especially
an old one, is a very rare thing. The
reason is that sapphires are so hard that it's
very difficult to engrave them, and so signets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
were not very often made of them. So, if this
signet were found, it would probably be worth
a great deal of money. But, more than that,
he thinks we owe it as a duty to the memory of
little Alison to make some <i>effort</i>, at least, to
find it and restore it to her descendants or
family, if she has any left."</p>

<p>"That's what I've always thought, too!"
murmured Margaret, parenthetically.</p>

<p>"Well, he says he's been doing some '<i>Sherlock
Holmes</i>' thinking, and trying to imagine
where she could possibly have concealed that
trinket. He doesn't think she kept it hidden
about herself anywhere. She would probably
have thought that too dangerous, for she might
have been searched. And he can't bring himself
to think that she concealed it anywhere
about the house or in the grounds,&mdash;there
would have been such slight chance, in such a
case, of it ever getting back to Bermuda, or
her relatives ever having a chance to find it.
But he did wonder whether it might have been
hidden in the secret beam with the other half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
of the journal. You would surely have found
it, then, wouldn't you, Alexander?"</p>

<p>"Bet your life!" replied that youngster,
promptly. "If that dinky little do-dab had
been in there, yours truly would have cabbaged
it all right! I knew well enough it was my
last chance at <i>that</i> old dump, and I clawed
over every square inch of it a dozen times before
I rung off. No sirree! it wasn't <i>there</i>,
and you can take your Uncle Dudley's word
for it!"</p>

<p>"Then we'll count that out," went on Corinne.
"Father didn't think there was much
likelihood of it&mdash;only a remote possibility.
Then there remain only two other possibilities,
and he thinks the most likely one was&mdash;the old
leather covers of the journal!"</p>

<p>"Oh, why did we never think of it ourselves!"
cried Margaret excitedly. Then, a
moment later, with the droop of disappointment
to her mouth: "But if that's so, then
it's gone forever&mdash;thanks to Sarah! She had
a red-hot fire that day, I know, and the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
would have dropped in the ashes and never
been found in the world!"</p>

<p>"But how could the signet have been hidden
in the cover?" queried Bess, skeptically. "It
must have been rather bulky, and <i>we</i> never
saw any evidence of such a thing!"</p>

<p>"No," corrected Corinne, "Father says the
signet was probably rather flat, and if Alison
was at all clever, she could easily have slid it
under the lining of one of the covers (which
were very thick, if you remember) and pasted
it up so it would never be noticed. He says
he's known of stranger things than that being
done. Anyhow, he thinks that is the place in
which she would have been most likely to hide
it. And if she did, of course, we have no hope
of ever finding it now. But there's one other
possibility&mdash;and that's our 'last chance'!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what <i>is</i> it?" they all demanded, as she
came to a provoking pause.</p>

<p>"<i>The little hair-trunk!</i>"</p>

<p>Margaret raised herself in bed and shouted
feebly, "Hurrah!" and then added, "But how
in the world are we ever to get at it?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>"That's just the point!" added Corinne.
"He says we must devise a way of getting at
that trunk, somehow, and since you all are
better acquainted with Sarah and her vagaries
than he is, he leaves it to you to concoct some
plan. If you can't think of <i>any</i> other way,
we'd better tell your mother, and have her
order Sarah to unlock the attic. But of course
that would spoil our secret society, and we
won't try that except as a last resort."</p>

<p>"I have an idea!" cried Margaret, suddenly.
"I'll ask Mother to-night about the trunk, and
beg her to let me have it to keep some of my
books and things in, because I've taken a
fancy to it. I'm sure she won't refuse me.
And if she orders Sarah to let me have the
trunk, Sarah'll just have to do it!"</p>

<p>They all agreed that the plan looked exceedingly
hopeful, and Corinne left for home
with the assurance that the trunk would soon
be theirs to search from end to end.</p>

<p>But when Margaret came to talk it over
with her mother that night, she met with an
unexpected objection.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear heart," said Mrs. Bronson, "you
know that I'd do everything in my power to
grant you any reasonable wish, but don't you
see that your request is a rather inconvenient
one at present? You know that you haven't
been really well for some time, and Sarah has
been working very, very hard taking care of
you days&mdash;and nights too, often. She's very
tired now and has been rather ill-humored
lately. Now, I don't know just what she
keeps in that little trunk, but I'm perfectly
sure that, if I ask her to empty it and change
things about in the attic, she won't take it very
pleasantly and <i>may</i> make an awful fuss!
And we can't afford to have her get upset and
leave just now, can we, dear?"</p>

<p>Margaret ruefully agreed, and had to be
satisfied with her mother's assurance that perhaps,
when she got better, and household matters
had smoothed out, Sarah might be approached
on the subject.</p>

<p>But this arrangement did not at all suit the
rest of the Antiquarian Club when they held a
solemn council next day.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>"Suffering Simpson!" exploded Alexander.
"If we wait for that hunk o' misery, Sarah, to
get in a good humor, we'll wait until horse-radish
tastes good on your ice-cream! Nix on
<i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>"Well, What are we going to do, then?" demanded
the others, despairingly.</p>

<p>"Just you leave it to yours truly!" announced
Alexander. "I've got a little
scheme!"</p>

<p>"Quick! Tell us what it is!"</p>

<p>Alexander gave an impudent wink, and remarked
casually: "I'm going to nose out
where Sarah keeps the key to the attic!"</p>

<p>"Splendid!" cried Corinne. "And what
then?"</p>

<p>"<i>Then</i>&mdash;" he finished dramatically, "we're
going to have a grand old meeting of the club
some day when she's out, and rip the stuffing
out of that trunk!"</p>

<p>It had seemed a simple thing, when Alexander
announced his plan, and every one supposed
it would soon be accomplished. But it
turned out to be a harder task than even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222&ndash;224</a></span>
he had anticipated. With infinite caution he
searched Sarah's room and all her belongings
when he knew she was safe in the kitchen, and
the twins aided him by keeping guard on the
stairs. But the key was not there. Next,
one night when all the household was abed, he
crept down and inspected every shelf and
cubbyhole and possible or impossible receptacle
in the kitchen and pantry. Neither was
it there. Margaret declared that she knew
Sarah did not carry it in her pocket, nor did
she appear to have anything hanging round
her neck.</p>

<p>"Then that lallypaloozer must have <i>swallowed</i>
it!" affirmed Alexander, angrily. "But
I'll make one more grand hunt in her room
this afternoon, if the twins will help me out by
watching the stairs. Maybe I overlooked
something!"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_223.jpg" alt="Penknife" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small">He began to tap the inside of the trunk all over, carefully, with the<br /> handle of his penknife</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Half an hour later he burst into Margaret's
room with a whoop. "Call a meeting of the
whole club for next Thursday afternoon&mdash;it's
Sarah's day out!" he whispered jubilantly.
"I found it!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, where, where?" demanded Margaret,
scarcely believing it could be true.</p>

<p>"<i>In the toe of one of her old shoes!</i>"</p>


<p class="p2t">On the last Thursday afternoon of each
month it was Sarah's custom to go out by herself
for three or four hours, leaving the house
and Margaret in charge of the twins. This
was the only outing she ever took. On the
day in question it was understood that Corinne
and her father (who insisted on being present
at this important meeting) should arrive at
three-thirty&mdash;after Sarah had gone, or she
might, on seeing them, change her mind and
stay home! Alexander was then to filch the
key from her shoe, open the attic, and, with the
help of the twins, carry the trunk down to
Margaret's room.</p>

<p>Everything worked smoothly. Sarah departed
as usual, Mr. Cameron and Corinne
arrived, tingling with excitement, Alexander
opened the attic, and the wonderful old trunk
was at last deposited in triumph before Margaret's
bed. They turned out the family's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
summer flannels carefully, that no spot or
wrinkle on them might in the future disturb
the equilibrium of the uncertain Sarah, and
examined the false bottom with an actual thrill
to think that here, in this very spot, poor frightened
little Alison was wont to conceal the telltale
journal.</p>

<p>But when the false bottom was removed,
there appeared no trace of a jewel (as they
had all secretly hoped there might be) nor any
crack or crevice where it might be concealed.
The old-fashioned lining was absolutely intact.
Margaret gave a little sigh of disappointment,
but Mr. Cameron remarked:</p>

<p>"Don't be discouraged! We haven't finished
yet!" And he began to tap the inside of
the trunk all over, carefully, with the handle
of his penknife. Then, suddenly, they beheld
him open the knife and skilfully slip up the
figured lining far in one corner. In another
second he had inserted his fingers in the opening
and was feeling about eagerly. The next
moment he laid something in Margaret's lap,
with just this quiet remark:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>"At last, Miss President! <i>The sapphire
signet!</i>"</p>

<p>There was an instant of amazed silence.
Then, at an indistinct sound from downstairs,
Bess uttered a horrified cry:</p>

<p>"Merciful goodness! Sarah's come back
already! What <i>shall</i> we do!"</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="small">IN WHICH SARAH CHANGES HER MIND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> was indeed Sarah! The sound of her
latch-key in the basement door was unmistakable.
What could have induced her to return
when she had been away scarcely more
than an hour, they could not imagine, unless
it was her anxiety on Margaret's account. At
any rate, there she was, and a panic of consternation
seized them all. Even the wonderful
signet was forgotten in the stress of the
moment. Strangely enough, it was Margaret
who first regained her poise and grasped the
situation.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she whispered. "Corinne and
Jess, get those things back in the trunk&mdash;any
old way! Bess, you go out and call down to
ask her what's the matter. Maybe she isn't
coming up just yet!"</p>

<p>They got to work in frantic haste, and Bess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
went out in the hall to make her inquiries of
Sarah.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Sarah? You're back
very early!" they heard her ask. And an
answering voice from the basement stairs responded:</p>

<p>"Sure 'tis rare unhealthy weather fur this
time of year! 'Twas so war-rm I nearly
roasted in me heavy coat&mdash;and we not out of
winter yet! I come back fur me lighter cape.
'Tis hangin' in the attic!"</p>

<p>"We're lost!" muttered Mr. Cameron as
Bess rushed in, despair written all over her
face. "Can't any one think of something to
keep her downstairs for five minutes?"</p>

<p>And this time it was Alexander who came to
the rescue.</p>

<p>"Just watch your Uncle Dudley!" he whispered,
as he ambled with apparent unconcern
out of the room. "If you hear me call her
down, give that trunk the boost to the attic as
soon as you can, and put the key back in her
shoe."</p>

<p>They heard him leisurely descending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
stairs, and Sarah's massive tread approaching
nearer and nearer. At one point there came
sounds as of a slight scuffle, and muttered remarks
of "Spalpeen!" and "I'll fix you yet,
young man!" Then Alexander passed on,
whistling derisively, and Sarah's heavy feet
began the ascent of the second-story flight.
Up and up she came, and still nothing happened.
Hope died out in the listening group,
for they were sure now that, whatever Alexander
might do, it would be too late to avert
the catastrophe. Sarah had, indeed, just
planted a broad foot on the top step when they
heard Alexander's shrill voice calling from the
basement:</p>

<p>"Oh, Sarah! Sarah! Come quick! There's
something afire in the kitchen!"</p>

<p>"Saints save us!" They heard her exclaim,
and she turned to descend with a speed of
which they had never dreamed her capable.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's anything <i>serious</i>?" whispered
Jess to Mr. Cameron. "Oughtn't we
go down, too?"</p>

<p>"No indeed!" he laughed. "I guess we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
trust Alexander. Fortunately, the trunk is
very light, so you girls can get it upstairs
while I listen in the hall to see if they need
help below."</p>

<p>In five minutes the three girls had the trunk
safely back in its place, and the key restored,
and were back in Margaret's room, panting
from exertion and breathless excitement.
But it was at least a quarter of an hour before
Alexander came up again, chuckling and
smoke-blackened.</p>

<p>"Well, this is one time when we put it all
over the lallypaloozer!" he exclaimed jubilantly.
"I got that pail of glue I keep in the
yard to paste kites with, and put it on the gas-stove
as if I was going to heat it. Then I
accidentally-on-purpose dropped a lighted
match into that big tin thing where Sarah
keeps the waste paper and scraps. It made a
big blaze, but I knew it couldn't hurt anything,
'cause it's tin all around it. But I
raised a hullabaloo like you'd thought the
Woolworth Building was going up in blue
smoke! It fetched her down, all right, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
figure it'll keep her there a good spell! The
gas-stove's all smoky, and she's cleaning it
up and growling like a bear, so I beat it up
here!"</p>

<p>Then at last, with their minds relieved, did
they have their first opportunity to consider
their wonderful "find," and they all crowded
around Margaret, in whose little white palm
it lay. The gold setting at the back was
tarnished quite black, but the jewel itself was
apparently unchanged. They gave an involuntary
gasp as they examined it, for it was
even more beautiful than they had imagined.
The flat sapphire itself was as large as a big
Lima bean, flawless, and curiously engraved
with the old-English letter "T," and a crest
above it, looking like two eagles holding a
sword. The surrounding diamonds were tiny,
but finely cut and still brilliant.</p>

<p>"Isn't it almost unbelievable," half whispered
Margaret, at last, "to think that right
here in my hand I hold the very jewel that cost
poor Alison so much pain and trouble! And,
oh! to think, besides, that it never got back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Bermuda, after all, and probably she didn't
either. It makes me, feel just&mdash;sad&mdash;somehow!"</p>

<p>"But what are we going to do with it?" demanded
Corinne.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron had been examining the jewel
with all the ardor of a genuine lover of antiques.
He now spoke very quietly:</p>

<p>"There's only one thing to do, and it's a
solemn duty imposed on us by the writer of
that poor little journal you found. We must
make every effort to discover whether the
Trenhams in Bermuda have any descendants
or relatives existing to-day. No matter how
distant they may be, the signet must be returned
to them, for it was Alison's wish. If
we should find none, that is another matter.
I believe the jewel would then be rightly
counted the property of&mdash;the Bronsons of
Charlton Street!"</p>

<p>The Bronson contingent there present
gasped in chorus!</p>

<p>"But how shall we go about hunting up the
descendants of the Trenhams?" questioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Corinne. "That'll be a big piece of work,
won't it?"</p>

<p>"It probably will, and perhaps a very complicated
one, besides," agreed Mr. Cameron.
"We had better start our investigations with
the Bermuda records, and I'll write down
there to the authorities asking how I can get
hold of data about the family history. The
matter must be dealt with very carefully, because
it is really no light affair. I am convinced,
even in this hasty examination, that the
signet is very rare and of very considerable
value, not only because of the stone itself, but
of its antiquity. It must not be lightly given
away. Its ownership must be proved beyond
a doubt. I expect to be extremely busy for
the next three or four weeks, and may have
little time to give to this matter. But after
that, when business slackens, I can give this
the attention it deserves. Meantime, I think
perhaps it had better be kept in my safe-deposit
box at the bank, where it will be absolutely
safe. We won't trust <i>this</i>, at least, to
Sarah's tender mercies!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Corinne cried out in perplexity:
"But this makes our mystery deeper than ever!
Do you realize it, folks? What became of
poor little Alison, after all? And why were
her trunk and her jewel and half her journal
found floating about in a wrecked vessel?"</p>

<p>"I tell you, she had to 'walk the plank'!"
reiterated Alexander. "I said so before, and
now I believe it! It'd make a gorgeous old
pirate yarn!"</p>

<p>"She didn't! She didn't!" wailed Margaret.
"I won't believe such a thing!"</p>

<p>"Never mind what happened&mdash;just yet!" interrupted
Mr. Cameron, soothingly. "The
Antiquarian Club's going to find out the truth
some time&mdash;I'm convinced of that!"</p>


<p class="p2t">It was two weeks later, about the middle of
March, when Corinne came in to see Margaret
one afternoon with considerable suppressed
excitement in her manner. Margaret was
still confined to her bed, and, though scarcely
so listless as she had seemed at first, she was
undoubtedly weaker. Corinne's visits were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
now her mainstay of pleasure and interest, and
she welcomed the girl with a glad little cry.</p>

<p>"I've got news for you, Honey!" said Corinne,
laying her usual offering of flowers and
fresh fruit on the bed.</p>

<p>"What?" cried Margaret, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, you mustn't be surprised, but
Father hasn't been a bit well again, lately.
The weather's awfully hard on him, and his
business has rushed him, too, and he's all run
down. So in a couple of weeks he's going
to take a vacation and go down to Bermuda
again. It did him a lot of good last time.
He'll stay at least a month, and longer if he
feels like it."</p>

<p>"Isn't that nice!" cried Margaret, with
great interest. "I'm awfully sorry he doesn't
feel well, but I'm glad he can go to such a
lovely place and get better. You'll miss him
though, won't you, Corinne, because you seem
to be with him such a lot,&mdash;more than most
girls are with their fathers!"</p>

<p>"No," said Corinne, slowly, "I won't miss
him, because&mdash;I'm going with him!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret stared at her a moment wide-eyed,
and her chin quivered&mdash;just a mere trifle.
But she braced up with a visible effort and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, Corinne! how lovely! You certainly
are a lucky girl!" Then the chin began to
quiver harder, and all at once poor little Margaret
completely lost control of herself, and
buried her head in the pillow, sobbing:</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>am</i> glad! I really am glad for you,
Corinne! Don't mind this! Only it just
seemed as though I <i>couldn't</i> live without you
for so long!"</p>

<p>Corinne gathered the sobbing form in her
arms and crooned to her: "You won't have
to, dearie, for&mdash;<i>you're going along, too</i>!"</p>

<p>Margaret sprang back from her embrace,
pushed the tangled curls from her eyes, and
gazed at Corinne as though her friend had suddenly
gone crazy.</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" was the only word she could utter.</p>

<p>"Now, just you let me explain it all," began
Corinne, soothingly, settling down on the bed
beside her. "And don't you get so excited, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
it isn't good for you. I'll tell you the
whole story. It was like this. After Father
found it was best to go to Bermuda, he made
up his mind that Aunt Katharine and I might
as well go, too, because he hates to go alone.
And, of course, I was crazy to go, but just one
thing kept me from being <i>entirely</i> delighted,
and that was&mdash;<i>you</i>! I hated to leave you, because
I love you, and also because you are not
at all well just now. Father and I have both
been very anxious about you. So we got to
talking it over, and suddenly he said: 'Why
not invite Margaret to come along with you as
your guest! The trip might do her a great
deal of good, and I know you two are growing
as inseparable as a pair of Siamese twins!'</p>

<p>"Well, you can just warrant I was delighted,
for I knew Father'd never make such
a suggestion unless <i>he</i> really wanted you, too!
He said he would call on your mother at her
place of business, and see if she would consent,
and also on your doctor, to see if he thought
the trip would be advisable. I begged him to
make them keep it a secret, so that, if everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
went well, I could surprise you with the
news when it was all settled. I hated to have
you disappointed in case the doctor thought it
wasn't wise, or your mother felt that she
couldn't consent to your going.</p>

<p>"Your mother was awfully surprised, of
course, and for a while she almost refused, because
she felt it to be too much for Father to
do. But when she found that it was going to
do you so much good, and how terribly I
wanted you, she gave in. And you needn't
worry about being taken care of and having
everything done for you that Sarah does.
<i>I'm</i> going to do that! It's to be my job, being
your lady's maid, and won't I enjoy it!
Aunt Katharine will help too, when necessary.
She's lovely and kind and gentle, and you're
going to like her a lot!</p>

<p>"Honey, we sail a week from next Wednesday,
and I can hardly wait for the time to
come!"</p>


<p class="p2t">There was surprise and rejoicing in the
Charlton Street house that night when Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Bronson arrived and the great secret became
public property. Mrs. Bronson admitted that
she had known about it for several days, and
was having a pretty outfit of traveling clothes
made for Margaret. The twins were frankly
delighted, for they had been themselves experiencing
much secret anxiety on account of
Margaret's precarious health, as indeed had all
the household. Alexander gave an Indian
war-whoop that was ear-splitting and performed
the acrobatic feat of standing on his
head in the middle of the parlor floor for
three minutes unassisted! The extraordinary
racket brought an indignant Sarah up from
the kitchen to investigate.</p>

<p>But it was when Sarah heard the news that
consternation fell upon the happy household.
She placed both hands on her massive hips,
threw back her head, squared her shoulders,
and announced:</p>

<p>"If Margie puts one fut aboard that rampagin'
ship, I go out of this house, never to
retur-rn!"</p>

<p>Now, when the autocratic Sarah made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
statement of this nature, it was time for the
family to tremble! Mrs. Bronson argued,
pleaded, commanded&mdash;in vain. Sarah could
no more be budged from her position than the
Rock of Gibraltar. Urged to state her
reasons, she would offer but two. And these
were that, about forty years ago, she herself
had come over from Ireland in a truly "rampagin'"
ship, and never again would she trust
herself or any one she held dear to the mercies
of the ocean. Arguments that ship-building
had made some progress and traveling was
safer since those days had absolutely no effect
on her&mdash;in fact, she refused to believe them!</p>

<p>Her second reason was that Margaret had
been in her care ever since she was born, and
no one else knew so well what to do for the
delicate child. She was firmly convinced that
it would be the death of her beloved charge to
be removed from her oversight. At last the
distracted Mrs. Bronson laid the matter aside
for the night, the girls retired to bed in tears
and indignation, and Alexander dared to
shake his fist at the broad back of Sarah departing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
to the kitchen. Only Margaret remained
in ignorance of the impending disaster,
and fell asleep happy beyond words.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Bronson sent a request
to Mr. Cameron to call that evening, for she
felt that the situation must be explained to
him. It would be a serious matter if Sarah
kept her word&mdash;as she doubtless had every intention
of doing. It also was important, for
the sake of Margaret's health, that she should
get away and have this wonderful change.
Mrs. Bronson was a sorely troubled woman as
she explained the circumstances to her visitor.
Mr. Cameron sat in deep thought for a few
moments. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Could you have your housekeeper come up
here for a few minutes and allow me to see her
alone?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bronson declared that it was entirely
possible, summoned Sarah, who arrived full of
hostile intent, introduced her to the visitor,
and went upstairs, leaving them together for
a while. Margaret had by this time learned of
the trouble, and was nervous and anxious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
feverish. Corinne, who had come with her
father, was sitting with her, trying to assure
her that she need not worry. But the assurance
rang hollow in her own ears. She, too,
knew Sarah!</p>

<p>Presently they were surprised to hear
her heavy footsteps coming upstairs. They
passed the door and entered Mrs. Bronson's
room. Then, in a moment, they returned,
halted, and a singularly changed Sarah stood
in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Yer father's goin' now, Miss Corinne, and
he wants ye," she announced in a strangely
meek, quiet voice. "I'll be back in two
minutes to fix me child for the night. We
got to get her in good shape before she takes
that rampagin' ship for Bermudy!"</p>

<p>That was all, but she actually <i>smiled</i>&mdash;a
weak, apologetic little smile&mdash;before she vanished
from the doorway!</p>

<p>The girls stared at each other in complete
bewilderment. Never had they witnessed a
change more astonishing.</p>

<p>"Well, doesn't that beat everything!" exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Margaret. "What could have happened
to Sarah?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Corinne, "except
that Father's had a talk with her. He told
me, coming over, that your mother had called
him up to-day on the telephone, explained
some of the trouble, and asked him to call to-night.
He said he himself was going to have
an interview with Sarah, and I told him it
probably wouldn't do any good. But he said
he had something that he thought would convince
her ladyship pretty speedily. But he
also said I was <i>not</i> to ask him what it was!
Some time he might tell me, but not at present.
Isn't that mysterious! I really didn't think
he'd succeed. He evidently has! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"But what <i>can</i> he have said to Sarah that
would make her change around so!" marveled
Margaret.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't imagine!" cried Corinne.
"But never you mind, honey dear! A week
from next Friday we step off on the island
that was Alison's home! And nothing else
matters!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="small">TWO SURPRISES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"It</span> seems awfully queer to me," remarked
Bess, sitting in the Charlton Street parlor
one afternoon in May, reading a recently
received letter with a foreign postmark, "that
Margaret says absolutely nothing at all, lately,
about whether they've done any work in hunting
up clues to the sapphire signet mystery!"</p>

<p>"Neither does Corinne," added Jess, looking
over a similarly marked letter that she
held. "They've neither one mentioned the
subject since they sent up that snap-shot of
the Tobacco Rocks some weeks ago. Corinne
said then that they'd driven to see them one
day, and she had 'snapped' them for our
special benefit, because Alexander had discovered
that it was from there the stolen gunpowder
was shipped. I don't think they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
much, if anything, to do with <i>our</i> affair, so
I wasn't so much interested in them. I never
felt at all convinced that those two happenings
had any connection whatever."</p>

<p>"Nor I, either!" agreed Bess. "I wonder
whether they <i>have</i> looked up anything about
Alison, or whether they've been having such a
good time that they've forgotten it completely!
My! but I envy them! Here we are
in this mussy, foggy, chilly, wretched city,&mdash;grubbing
along at high, without even time to
have a game of basket-ball, lately! And listen
to what Margaret says of their surroundings:</p>

<p>"'You never saw such blue, blue water in
your life! And the weather's so warm that
Corinne and her father have been in bathing
several times! I never saw any one <i>swim</i> before!
Corinne swims beautifully! It is so
lovely in this place that I'm sure Heaven
couldn't be any more beautiful. I begin to
feel so much stronger! I'm out every day
and all of the day! Isn't that wonderful&mdash;for
me! Mr. Cameron says he feels like a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
being, too. We are going to stay two weeks
longer, because it's doing us all so much
good.'"</p>

<p>"Bless her heart!" cried Jess. "I'm just
the gladdest girl that ever was because she
could go and is getting on so well. Do you
know, I believe she'd have died pretty soon if
she'd kept on as she was the last of the winter!
I felt perfectly certain then, that she wasn't
going to live, though I never told a soul! I
was absolutely in despair about her!"</p>

<p>"Same here!" echoed Bess. "I was going
through some mental tortures, too, but I
wasn't bothering any one else with them!
Corinne and her father just saved Margaret's
life, <i>I</i> believe. But here's something queer
in her letter! I just came to it. She ends by
saying:</p>

<p>"'We have <i>two surprises</i> for you, but you
are not to know a thing about them till we get
home! Oh, I can just see you <i>wiggling</i> with
impatience to know what they are! But it's
useless for you to beg; not a word will we whisper
till we land in America!'</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"Now <i>what</i> do you make of that?" demanded
the bewildered Bess.</p>


<p class="p2t">The day came at last, when the travelers
were expected to land once more on their
native shores. To the twins it had seemed an
interminable age&mdash;the more so since the intended
absence of a month had lengthened itself
to ten long weeks. It had taken longer to
restore Mr. Cameron's health than he had imagined,
and, besides, Margaret had improved
so perceptibly that they decided to stretch the
time of the trip to the limit.</p>

<p>They had sailed away on a stormy day in
March. They were expected back on the
rarest kind of a day in June, and the entire
Charlton Street household was assembled at
the pier to meet the incoming steamer. This
had been the request of Mr. Cameron himself,
who had written to Mrs. Bronson that, for a
sufficient reason, he wished every one of them
to be there, including Sarah.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock on a golden afternoon
when the <i>Bermudian</i> came steaming slowly up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
the river, picking her stately course among the
heavy ferry-boats and darting tugs that
blocked the way. Alexander, from a perilous
perch on one end of the pier, announced its
coming with a whooping and a waving of his
cap, at which Sarah muttered awful remarks,
sounding like "Let him drown if he falls over&mdash;the
young spalpeen!" With beating hearts
they scanned the decks as the vessel drew close
to the side, and the twins quickly picked out
Corinne and her father waving from the side.
But of Margaret they could discern not a sign,
and an awful dread seized them that she must
be too ill to be with the others.</p>

<p>By a special permit, obtained through Mr.
Cameron, they had been admitted within the
custom-house lines to the very gangway entrance
itself. After maddening delays the
vessel was at last made fast, the gangways adjusted,
and the throngs began to come ashore.
It was toward the last that the ones they were
waiting for so anxiously appeared at the top,
and then it was only Corinne and her father
and aunt who came down.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>"But, oh! where is <i>Margaret</i>?" cried Bess,
as Corinne rushed to embrace her. "Why
isn't she with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll be along in a minute!" announced
Corinne, unconcernedly. Then suddenly
she turned, and said quietly:</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>They turned at her command, and glanced
upward expecting to see their sister in her
usual wheel-chair. Instead, there at the top
of the gangway&mdash;<i>stood</i> Margaret, rosy,
plump, and browned by the sun! And under
her arms were a pair of <i>crutches</i>! When she
saw her own family below, she blew them a
kiss, adjusted her crutches, and proceeded
down the gangway alone, haltingly, it is true,
but refusing the assistance of the anxious
steward who hovered behind her!</p>

<p>To the members of her family, who never in
all their lives had beheld her on her feet, the
sight was almost overwhelming. The twins
and their mother were actually too stunned to
speak, and Alexander relieved himself only by
a low-muttered, "<i>Can</i> you beat it!"&mdash;his favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
expression of surprise. But it was Sarah
who did the most astonishing thing. She tore
up the gangway, snatched Margaret when she
was but half-way down, and bore her back,
crutches and all, to the group below, crying:</p>

<p>"Me little darlint! It's true! It's true!
I didn't believe it!"</p>


<p class="p2t">The Charlton Street house was a scene that
night of such festivity and rejoicing as it had
probably never known before in all its history.
Corinne and her father and aunt had accompanied
the Bronsons home, and stayed to a
feast that Sarah had evolved in some sudden
and mysterious manner, for she had been away
from the house all of the afternoon. But
Sarah was an adept at such bits of necromancy.
Then, when the older folks were still talking
hard and fast, the five young people drew
apart by themselves, and Jess said:</p>

<p>"Now, for goodness' sake, explain the whole
business again! My brain is so bewildered I
can't seem to understand it all yet!"</p>

<p>It was Corinne who tried to straighten out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
the tangle. She told how, before they started
on their trip, her father had suddenly become
possessed with the idea that perhaps something
could be done to help Margaret's trouble if
only the right physician could be found. It
happened that he was personally acquainted
with a doctor famous for his success in this very
kind of case and who also usually spent a few
weeks at that season of the year in Bermuda.
If Margaret could be helped by any one in the
world, Mr. Cameron felt sure it would be by
this surgeon. So he privately made up his
mind that the famous specialist should be consulted
as soon as they got there. But of this
he said not a word to any one, lest it should
only be a cause of disappointment in case no
good was accomplished.</p>

<p>Corinne laughed, however, when she said
there was one exception to this. On the night
when Sarah had issued her awful ultimatum,
Mr. Cameron made up his mind that the only
way to influence her was to tell her, privately,
his hopes for Margaret. This he did, and it
had the remarkable effect that had so bewildered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
them. This, also, was the reason
why Sarah seemed the least surprised and had
said such strange things that day at the pier.</p>

<p>The doctor had been consulted soon after
they reached Bermuda and when Margaret
had grown a little stronger. His verdict was
that with a certain kind of treatment there was
a slight hope that she might some day recover
the use of her limbs. This treatment she had
had during the whole of their stay, with the
wonderful result that, two weeks before their
return, Margaret took her first steps with the
crutches. The specialist himself was returning
to New York shortly and would continue
his work with her. He was now almost positive
that she might, in the course of time, even
discard her crutches and walk alone, on her
two feet, unassisted, like the rest of ordinary
humanity. It was a treat to watch the beaming
happiness on Margaret's face while Corinne
rehearsed this tale. It spoke more eloquently
than any words she could have uttered.</p>

<p>"Well, that's your big surprise!" sighed
Bess, contentedly. "And it certainly is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
monster one! Now what's the other? You
know you wrote that there were two!"</p>

<p>"The other's almost as big!" exclaimed
Margaret, her eyes snapping with eagerness.
"We've found out the <i>whole</i> history of Alison,
and solved every bit of the mystery!"</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" cried three of the listeners in astonishment.
"Honestly? Tell us&mdash;right away!
We thought you'd forgotten all about it!"</p>

<p>"No," said Margaret, "I'm not going to tell
you just now. To-morrow we'll have a big
old meeting of the Antiquarian Club, and
we'll give the entire account then! Not a
minute before!"</p>

<p>"But did you find the owner of the sapphire
signet?" they clamored.</p>

<p>And to this, also, the provoking Margaret
would only lay her finger on her lips, and smile,
and murmur, "<i>To-morrow!</i>"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="small">THE MISSING LINKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">"So</span> you thought that because we were having
such a good time in Bermuda, we
had forgotten all about the mystery!" laughed
Margaret, the next afternoon, at the grand assembly
of the Antiquarian Club. They were
all gathered in the Charlton Street parlor&mdash;all
but Mr. Cameron. He had, indeed, fully expected
to be present, not intending to go to
his office till the following day. But unexpected
business had called him there, after all,
so he could only send his hearty regrets to the
meeting of the club. It seemed like old times
for the young folks to be together again in
this familiar room. The only wonderful difference
was in Margaret. No longer was she
ensconced in her accustomed wheel-chair, but
in a big "comfy" armchair, with her cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
crutches leaning against its arm. No longer
did she seem a wan, frail, delicate little invalid,
but a brown, rosy, plump, and increasingly
energetic young person. But the sweetness
of her smile and the shy, trusting expression
of her big gray eyes had not changed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you all must have thought
we'd forgotten it," she went on; "but we
hadn't&mdash;not for a minute! Only, for several
weeks, we didn't seem to make any progress
with it at all. We used to inquire of every
native Bermudian we met if he or she had ever
heard of any one living there by the name of
Trenham; but no one seemed to have any ideas
at all about it. They'd say they hadn't heard
of the name themselves, but would always refer
you to some one else, who would turn out to
know as little as they did! It was awfully
discouraging! Finally, Mr. Cameron suggested
that the only way would probably be
to go around to all the different parish
churches and consult the old parish registers
for the lists of births and marriages and
deaths. He thought the name had probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
died out long ago, and perhaps no relatives or
descendants remained, or were even remembered.</p>

<p>"Well, this seemed a big piece of work, of
course, and none of us felt quite like attempting
it just then, for Mr. Cameron wasn't yet
a bit well himself, and I was having treatments
every day with the big doctor in Hamilton.
So we decided to put it off for a while.
And then&mdash;meantime&mdash;a very unexpected
thing happened!</p>

<p>"You know, we were staying at a big hotel
about four miles from Hamilton, near Harrington
Sound. Mr. Cameron likes it there
because it's out of the city, well away from
everything distracting, like the things going on
in Hamilton. Part of this hotel is big and
new, but another section, where the dining-room
is, has been standing for over two
hundred years. You can see how old it is by
its very looks, and we heard that it was really
the old homestead of the proprietor's ancestors.</p>

<p>"The housekeeper is a dear, kindly lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
and we got rather well acquainted with her,
because often we had to ask her for different
and rather unusual things for me. She was
just lovely to me, always, and after a while we
had some long, interesting talks with her about
Bermuda and the different families living
there. And once she took us up to her own
apartments, in the old part of the house, and
showed us a collection of the most wonderful
old furniture and antiques that had been in her
own and her husband's families since way, way
back. Corinne and her father went just wild
over them, for you know how they love antiques!</p>

<p>"Well, one day we thought we'd ask <i>her</i>
if she'd ever heard of any one on the island by
the name of Trenham. She said no, she
hadn't, but, if we were interested to find out,
she'd take us over to the South Shore to see
a very old lady there who knew lots and lots
about Bermuda history and former people.
She said she was driving to Hamilton that
morning on some business, but would first take
us over to the Jewell Farm, introduce us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
old Mrs. Jewell, go on to Hamilton, and come
back to get us later. She declared that the
old lady would be delighted to have us come,
because she was blind now and had very little
to entertain her, and she loved to talk to
people.</p>

<p>"This seemed too good a chance to lose, and
Corinne and I accepted at once. Mr. Cameron
had gone off on a fishing-trip, so he
couldn't be included. We piled into the big,
comfy carriage, and you ought to see that
great, strapping driver lift me in and out and
carry me around! Well, we got to the Jewell
Farm over on the South Shore, and, oh, folks!
how I wish you could all see that place! It's
simply the most charming old house&mdash;two
hundred and fifty years old!&mdash;set high on a hill
overlooking that marvelous blue ocean, with
a garden all around it that is like the things
you dream about! We took some pictures of
the house and garden which I'll show you
later, but they don't do it anything like justice.
You can only get a faint idea of its <i>real</i>
beauty!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>"And the whole house, inside, was filled with
the dearest old-time furniture! It nearly set
Corinne crazy! But never mind about all that
now&mdash;we must come to the <i>best</i> part! The
driver carried me in, and we were introduced
to the sweetest old lady you ever saw! She
was nearly ninety-five, with snow-white hair;
and a dainty lace cap over it. Her eyes were
pretty and blue, and you'd hardly guess, to
look at her, that she couldn't see a thing. If
she'd known us all her life, she couldn't have
received us more cordially, or seemed less surprised
to have complete strangers landed on
her without any warning. She made us feel
at home and acquainted right away, and after
a few moments the housekeeper left us alone
with her and went on to Hamilton.</p>

<p>"We didn't like to introduce the subject we
were most interested in right away, so we
chatted with her about her lovely old home, and
the furniture in it, and its history. After a
while, though, when we could bring it in naturally,
we asked her if she had ever known
any one by the name of Trenham in Bermuda.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
She gave the most curious little start, but only
said very quietly:</p>

<p>"'I would like to know why you ask?
Whom do you know of that name?' Well,
Corinne and I looked at each other and I saw
we were agreed that it was time to make a bold
move, so I said right out that we were very
much interested in some one who lived in Bermuda
a long while ago and whose name was
Alison Trenham.</p>

<p>"Folks, if I live to be a hundred, I'll never
forget the strange expression that came over
that old lady's face when I spoke that name!
For a minute or two she didn't answer&mdash;just
sat quietly thinking. Then at last she said,
still very quietly:</p>

<p>"'Yes, I know the name! I have heard of
only one Alison Trenham in my life, and that
was&mdash;<i>my grandmother</i>!'"</p>

<p>There was a gasp and a start from her
listeners, and Margaret laughed as she continued:</p>

<p>"You'd just better believe <i>we</i> jumped, too!
And I thought Corinne's eyes would pop out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of her head&mdash;she looked so startled! I just
couldn't help smiling to myself at her expression,
though I was so deep in other things.
Then I said:</p>

<p>"'Well, Mrs. Jewell, since you <i>do</i> know an
Alison Trenham, and she was your own grandmother,
I guess we'd just better tell you our
whole story. For the two Alisons <i>may</i> turn
out to be the same!' Then, as quickly as I
could, I told her all about finding the trunk
and the journal, and our Antiquarian Club,
and all the discoveries we made afterward, and
how we'd come to a snag and could get no
further. I even told her how Sarah had
burned the original journal. But I didn't say
a word about the sapphire signet&mdash;just then.
I wish you could have seen the expression on
her face all the time I was talking! It was as
though she were listening to a story so strange
that she couldn't believe a word of it! I ended
by begging her, please, if she could throw the
least light on our mystery, to oblige us by doing
so, as it was the chief aim of our Antiquarian
Club to find the key to the riddle!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>"She was silent a long time after I had finished&mdash;so
long that we were beginning to think
she must have fallen asleep, for she had covered
her eyes with her hand, and was leaning her
elbow on the arm of the chair. But suddenly
she spoke, saying very low:</p>

<p>"'All this seems like a dream to me! You
children have stumbled upon a secret that I
supposed no mortal would ever discover in this
world! The ways of chance are very mysterious!
Yes, it is the same Alison; and since you
know so much, I am going to tell you the rest
of the story, though she made me solemnly
promise, when I was a young girl, that I would
never tell a soul. That is why I was hesitating.
But I feel certain that, were she to know
these circumstances, she would have no real
objection to your knowing the whole story.
It can harm no one now&mdash;least of all herself!</p>

<p>"'As I told you, she was my grandmother.
I was born in 1820, and she was then a woman
sixty years old. My own mother and father
died in my infancy, and left me to her care.
This was her home, this same old farm, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264&ndash;266</a></span>
came here to live with her. We are a long-lived
race, here in Bermuda, and she lived on
to be almost ninety-five, as I myself am doing!
A few years before she died she told me that
she had something on her conscience that she
would like to tell me, because she felt that she
would die happier, knowing that she had not
kept the secret unconfessed to the end. She
made me promise I would never disclose it, as
some of it had once been of political consequence,
and she had always feared its discovery.'</p>

<p>"And now, folks, I'm going to tell you the
story of Alison in my own words, because I
can't remember all of hers!" ended Margaret.
Then she re-settled herself in her big chair and
began anew, very much flattered by the breathless
attention of her auditors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_265.jpg" alt="Slow to answer" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small">"For a minute or two she didn't answer"</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Alison Trenham lived on this same old
farm with her grandfather, Archibald Trenham.
Her parents had both been lost at sea
when she was little, and that's why she was
living with him. He was a queer, crabby sort
of an old man, and had never loved Alison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
because he was so disappointed she hadn't
been a boy. She was a big, beautiful-looking,
athletic girl, and he had had her taught to
ride, and swim, and sail a boat, and do most
of the things boys generally do, besides learning
to read and write and some Latin and
French. It was his whim that she should
be educated like a boy, even if she wasn't
one.</p>

<p>"But she was restless and discontented and
headstrong, and hated her life there with her
grandfather, and wanted the worst way to go
away from Bermuda altogether and see some
of the world. She had an aunt, a Madame
Pennington, living down at Flatts (that's
right where our hotel was), and a cousin Betty,
and she was very fond of them both. The
aunt was like a mother to her, and spoiled her
a lot. Well, Alison confided to her aunt that
she wanted to go away from Bermuda, but
that her grandfather wouldn't hear of it.
And she said she was so crazy to go that sometime
she was going to run away!</p>

<p>"The aunt was very much shocked, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
finally Alison begged her so hard that she consented
to write to a friend of hers in New
York, a Madame Mortier, and get her to invite
Alison up there for a long visit. Madame
Mortier wrote back that she would be delighted
to have Alison come, especially as her
husband had just lately died and she was very
lonely. So that much was arranged, and
Alison was delighted. But the difficulty was
to get away from Bermuda without her grandfather
knowing, for he would never have consented.
Alison discovered a way out of this
herself, and here comes the exciting part!
Alexander, you were <i>right</i>, after all, as you'll
see in a moment!"</p>

<p>"Oh, your Uncle Dudley's right sometimes,"
grumbled that irrepressible youngster,
trying to conceal his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Now, to go on. One day Alison happened
to meet, quite unexpectedly, a neighbor of
theirs, a young fellow named Harrington
Ord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>'H'!</i>" shouted the listening ones, simultaneously.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you're right! that was 'H'! He had
been away on a cruise with his uncle, George
Ord, in his uncle's ship, the <i>Lady</i>. Harrington
said they had only touched at St.
George's for a day or so to take on a cargo
of salt, and would then be off again for
America. Then Alison saw her chance. She
begged Harrington to ask his uncle if she
might be taken aboard to go with them without
letting her grandfather know. She knew
the uncle and her grandfather had some standing
quarrel between them, and that George
Ord would not be sorry to do anything to get
the best of the old man. Harrington hesitated
about it, then finally confided to her
the news that his uncle was engaged in a
strange plot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The gunpowder!" exclaimed the audience.</p>

<p>"Yes, the very thing! Alexander was exactly
right in his guess! George Ord was
planning to steal the gunpowder the very next
night, and all the details were arranged except
one thing, and that was puzzling them all
dreadfully. It was this: the governor slept with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the keys of the magazine under his pillow, and
how to get at them without disturbing him,
nobody could think. Some one had suggested
putting a heavy sleeping-powder in his food,
but that was all but impossible, as no one knew
any of his servants or could get into his
kitchen. Harrington had the powder in his
pocket, and, at his wits' end, he showed it to
Alison. She had an idea right away. She
told him to give it to her, and she would see
that it got to its proper destination all right,
if, in return, his uncle would take her secretly
to America.</p>

<p>"He declared that his uncle would be only
too delighted to reward her in that way, and
everything was arranged. She was to go next
day to her aunt's as if for a week's visit. That
same afternoon she would take a little cat-boat
and sail by herself up to St. George's,
and be taken aboard the <i>Lady</i> at sundown, as
she was setting sail, and when no one was
observing. But first she intended to stop at
the governor's mansion and make a call on his
niece, whom she knew rather well.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything went off like clockwork! Her
grandfather suspected nothing. She got to
her aunt's and bade her good-by, sailed up to
St. George's in her little dinghy, called on the
governor's niece, and, before she left, went
down to the kitchen to see the colored cook
Dinah, who was a sister of her grandfather's
cook and was rather fond of Alison. She
found, just as she had expected, that Dinah
was preparing the governor's little afternoon
snack of cake and a glass of wine. When
Dinah wasn't looking, she quietly dropped the
powder in the wine, and the game was won!
Later, as she went out, she saw him drinking
it.</p>

<p>"Well, the governor slept like a log that
night, and you all know how successful the
rest of the scheme was! Captain Ord was so
grateful to Alison that he couldn't do enough
for her. He landed in New York, and Harrington
escorted her to Richmond Hill, the
home of Madame Mortier. The old song,
'The Lass of Richmond Hill,' was very popular
just then, and Harrington kept teasing Alison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
by whistling and singing it constantly, and saying
<i>she</i> was now that 'lass'!</p>

<p>"Madame Mortier was lovely to her at first,
and seemed delighted to have her there. But
Alison didn't have a very lively time, because
Madame Mortier lived a very secluded
and quiet life, and her house was way off from
the city, and she never went anywhere. And
Alison found out, too, that she was a strict
Tory, and hated Washington and the rebels,
and felt very bitter about the war that was just
commencing. Now, Alison had heard a lot
about Washington from Captain Ord and
Harrington, who both admired him terrifically,
and she herself had begun to feel a great respect
for the rebel leader. But when she
spoke in praise of him, one day, Madame Mortier
just 'jumped on her,' as Alexander would
say, and almost went crazy denouncing him.</p>

<p>"Well, by and by Alison began to feel dreadfully
lonely and homesick, and just longed to
go back to Bermuda, and wished she'd never
come away! But getting back was more difficult
than coming to New York. She didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
like to tell Madame Mortier she was tired of
her and wanted to leave, for she had been invited
to stay a year, at least, as a companion
to the old lady. Then something happened
that changed the whole face of affairs for her&mdash;two
things, in fact!</p>

<p>"A sailor from Captain Ord's ship turned
traitor some months after the gunpowder affair,
and in Corbie's tavern let it all out and
told how Alison had been mixed up in the plot,&mdash;or
at least, that he suspected she was, for
he didn't actually know about her drugging
the governor. This got round to the steward,
whom we all know about, and finally was
hinted at by him to Madame Mortier. She
began to treat poor Alison very coldly and
suspiciously, without, however, telling her the
real reason. She evidently thought Alison
was some kind of a spy! And Alison never
guessed the reason till Harrington gave her
the hint that night under her window.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, that was when she first began to
feel uneasy, and as if things had changed in
the house and she was not altogether safe there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
But the climax came when one stormy winter
day she and Madame Mortier were driving
home along Greenwich road and saw ahead
of them a coach whose wheel had come off and
whose horses were snorting and kicking with
fright. The driver could seem to do nothing
with them. Alison got out, rushed to the
horses, and held them steady till they quieted
down. She knew horses well and just how to
treat them. Then, while the wheel was being
adjusted, she spoke to the occupant of the
coach, who proved to be none other than Lady
Washington!</p>

<p>"She was traveling through the city on her
way from Virginia to her husband's camp outside
Boston when the accident happened. She
congratulated Alison on her skill with horses,
and asked her about herself. Alison was just
beginning to tell her about Bermuda and how
she longed to go back, when Madame Mortier,
who had just learned about the occupant of
the broken coach, rushed up and dragged her
bodily away! And then things got worse and
worse!</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, there's no need of telling you all
that happened after that because we know it;
so I'll skip at once to the night of that last
entry in the journal, and explain how it came
to be so mysteriously broken off. While Alison
was sitting there writing, she suddenly
heard again the mysterious footsteps, just as
she had that time before. She was horribly
nervous, but she suspected something wrong
and crept to the door and opened it to peep
out. And there, sure enough, was the steward,
come back from Corbie's tavern, and evidently
going down to the cellar again! Alison
was scared to death, but, almost unconsciously,
she found herself creeping after him, her journal
still in her hand.</p>

<p>"Suddenly on the stairs something made
him turn&mdash;and he saw her! Before she could
cry out he made one leap and clapped his hand
over her mouth. Then with the other he tried
to get hold of the journal. She began to
struggle and twist, and try to keep it away
from him, and he whispered that if she made
a sound he would kill her right there! Still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
she kept struggling, but at last he got hold of
it and gave it a wrench. Of course it came
in half, and at the same moment she got free
from him and ran like mad to her own room
and locked herself in.</p>

<p>"She hid the half of the journal she had kept
hold of in the bottom of her trunk, and stayed
for hours shivering with fright and listening
at the door. Then, at last, not hearing anything
more, she crept out, and rushed to
Phœbe's room, and told her all about it. They
decided that it was best to wait no longer, but
tell the whole thing to Washington at early
dawn, and let him take matters into his own
hands. They had the interview, and Washington
acted on the matter at once. He got
his life-guard, Thomas Hickey, made him confess
the whole thing, and then sent out and
had every one of the conspirators arrested.
Strangely enough, the steward was nowhere
to be found. He had disappeared completely,
and was never seen or heard of again. He
had probably thought it wise to take flight in
the night. Alison always thought, too, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
he was intending to run away when he did,
anyhow, without warning any one, because he
had appropriated a lot of the gold and money
that was to be used in paying the conspirators.
That was what he had kept hidden in the beam,
and he had removed it all that very night, preparatory
to making off with it.</p>

<p>"Early that morning, Washington sent
Phœbe back to the city to stay with her father,
as she would be safer there. And as he
thought the house no longer a safe place for
his wife, either, he arranged to despatch her
at once with a strong escort to Philadelphia.
Alison had told him her own story, explained
how she aided in the gunpowder plot, and
begged him to send her back to Bermuda if
he could. He was so grateful to her for the
assistance which she had twice given that he
told her he would send her to Philadelphia
with Lady Washington, and there would arrange
that she should sail for her home as soon
as was possible.</p>

<p>"So Alison packed her little trunk, and without
even bidding Madame Mortier good-by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
(for of course she didn't dare see her) she
left that morning with Lady Washington, and
never again in all her life looked upon Richmond
Hill. In Philadelphia she was fortunate
enough to catch a vessel sailing at once for
Bermuda, but before she got to her home one
other accident was to happen to her. The ship
ran into a terrific storm and was completely
dismasted. It almost foundered, but, after
drifting around helplessly for more than a
week, the passengers and crew were at last rescued
by another vessel, leaving all their belongings
behind on the wreck, and finally were
landed in Bermuda.</p>

<p>"She went straight to her aunt first, for she
did not dare go to her grandfather, thinking
he had never forgiven her for running away.
But her aunt told her that her grandfather,
though terribly angry with her at first, was
now very, very ill, and kept constantly calling
for her. So she returned to him and was forgiven,
and nursed him tenderly till he died,
leaving her the fine old farm. A few years
later she married Harrington Ord, for he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
always admired and loved her. He died, in
later years, by falling from the mast of the
vessel of which he was captain, and Alison was
left alone with one daughter, who also married,
after a time, and it was <i>her</i> daughter,
old Mrs. Jewell, who told us the story. Alison
lived all her life in secret terror lest her
part in the gunpowder plot should ever be
discovered by the Bermudians, for she felt that
she had been disloyal to her country in the
part she played. Yet she never wholly regretted
it, because of the intense admiration
she always felt for Washington, and her gratitude
to him for his timely rescue of her. Madame
Mortier died soon after her departure,
and never knew about the defeat of her beloved
Tories.</p>

<p>"So that is the end of the story, folks, and I
guess I've explained everything!"</p>

<p>"No, you haven't!" said Alexander promptly.
"What about that half of the diary that
we found in the beam! Put us wise to that!"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, that's one of the things
we can't be absolutely certain about, but can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
only guess at. The steward had gone off with
that half, and Alison never saw it again. She
always wondered what became of it. We
think, though, that the steward must have come
back that night looking for the slip of paper
that he had forgotten or lost. He evidently
thought it might be left in his hiding-place,
and was on the way to hunt it up. Then he
had the encounter with Alison, and got hold
of that half of her diary. He must have taken
it to the cellar, examined it hurriedly, written
on it that mysterious sentence, and thrown it
into the opening where he hid his things.
Probably he looked for his paper, and, not
finding it, thought he'd dropped it elsewhere.
We think likely he didn't suspect that any
one had discovered the place in the beam.
That's the only explanation that seems possible."</p>

<p>"Yes," objected Alexander, still unconvinced,
"but how came it to remain there all
that time untouched? Didn't they go and
search the beam afterward? Didn't any one
else ever know about it?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it seems that Phœbe and Alison, in their
hurry that morning, did not think to tell Washington
where they had found the paper. They
didn't have time&mdash;everything had to be done
so quickly. They just gave it to him and told
who the conspirators were. Then Phœbe was
sent right off, and Alison went away, too, and,
of course, nobody else ever knew about it or
suspected it. So it lay through all the years
till Alexander unearthed it! Isn't it too wonderful!"</p>

<p>"Then that gink of a steward must have beat
it out for keeps!" commented Alexander.
"Guess he didn't think it'd be healthy for him
to shine about those parts again, after he'd
got away with all the swag! He was <i>some</i>
pippin, he was!"</p>

<p>"Well," ended Margaret, "now you know
all the mystery and the history of Alison Trenham,
and I hope you're satisfied!"</p>

<p>"<i>Satisfied!</i>" ejaculated Bess, sitting up very
straight. "When you haven't said one word
about the <i>sapphire signet</i>&mdash;the most important
thing of all? I guess <i>not</i>!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>"I was wondering when you'd begin to be
curious about that," commented Margaret,
with her tantalizing smile. "Since you seem
a little anxious on the subject, I'll go on with
the second half of the story. Well, as I've
hinted, we didn't say a word about the signet
to the old lady, and she didn't mention it in
her account either. But when she had finished,
Corinne asked her if there was anything else
she knew of that had troubled Alison's mind&mdash;whether
she'd ever heard her grandmother
speak of something she'd lost. And at that
Mrs. Jewell looked awfully surprised, and said
no, her grandmother had never spoken of anything
else, and what did we mean?</p>

<p>"Then we told her all about the signet, and
how we'd found it, and how valuable it was,
and how we wanted above everything to return
it to Alison's descendant, and were so glad
we'd found her at last. Well, if you'll believe
me, Mrs. Jewell looked simply stunned
for a while, as if she couldn't trust her senses!
And we had the hardest time convincing her
that the signet was really hers and she must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
take it. She insisted it ought to be ours, since
we had found it. But finally we managed to
convince her that she was its rightful owner,
and told her that Mr. Cameron would get it
from the safe at the hotel and bring it over to
her the next day."</p>

<p>"But why do you suppose Alison never told
her about it?" interrupted Jess.</p>

<p>"That's just what we all couldn't fathom
for a while, till at last Mrs. Jewell explained
it in this way. Of course, when Alison was
shipwrecked and rescued, she naturally supposed
her trunk went down to the bottom of
the ocean with the wreck. She told her grandmother
that they had had to cling to the decks
for several days, and never dared to go down to
the cabins, for most of them were full of water.
So she couldn't get at her trunk to take out
anything. We think that when she realized
that the signet was lost forever, and after her
grandfather had forgiven her for everything
(including that, no doubt), she just forgot all
about the matter and either didn't think of it
again, or else didn't want to. What troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
her most was the fear that the second half of
her journal would sometime be discovered and
deciphered, and she, perhaps, be considered
a traitor for twice giving aid to Washington.</p>

<p>"But now listen to the best part of the story,
which comes last! We had asked Mrs. Jewell
to say nothing just yet about what we'd told
her, and when the housekeeper came back for
us, the old lady bade us good-by as calmly as
though we hadn't just given her the surprise
of her life. But on the drive to the hotel we
asked a few questions about her and found out,
to our astonishment, that old Mrs. Jewell was
really in very straitened circumstances. For
years she had supported herself by doing
the most beautiful lacework, and had earned
enough to live on. But since her blindness
came, her money had gradually disappeared,
and she had had to borrow on the farm and
the lovely old furniture. The housekeeper
said she was afraid it wouldn't be long before
she would lose everything. Every one was so
sorry for her and wanted to help, but she was
very proud and would accept nothing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
them. No one could imagine what she would
do when she was homeless.</p>

<p>"It set us thinking hard, of course, and we
told Mr. Cameron about it that night. He
only said we must leave it to him, and he'd
think out a scheme. Next day we three drove
over there with the signet, and placed it in
old Mrs. Jewell's hands. And right then and
there Mr. Cameron told her that, if she cared to
sell it to him, he'd be only too delighted to
buy it. And he offered her enough to keep
her living comfortably for the rest of her
days.</p>

<p>"You should have seen that poor old lady's
face! She begged and protested that he
should not give so much, that she could not accept
it. But he assured her that he knew positively
it was the real value of the signet, and
to prove it, read her a letter he'd received from
some authority in such things. She gave in
at last, and we left her with that big, fat check
in her hands&mdash;the happiest woman in all Bermuda!"</p>

<p>"But what has become of the sapphire signet?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
demanded her listeners, as Margaret
paused.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" said Corinne, quietly, and she
pulled from under the neck of her dress a thin
golden chain. There on the end dangled the
wonderful sapphire signet, more beautiful than
ever since it had been cleaned and polished.</p>

<p>"Father has given it to me, and I'm going
to keep it always, in memory of the long-ago
Alison and the strange way we stumbled on
her mystery. I shall not wear it all the time,
for it's too rare and valuable to run the risk
of losing. But I put it on to-day in honor of
the most satisfactory meeting the Antiquarian
Club ever held!"</p>


<p class="p2t">It was about noon of a day a week or two
later that Corinne and Margaret stood together
at the open window of the Charlton
Street parlor. A light breeze flapped the
awnings to and fro, a warm midday sun shone
on the pavements outside, and the droning
sound of busy Varick Street came distantly
to them as they stood looking out. The twins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
were still at high school, but Corinne had not
returned there, as she was expecting to study
up during the summer and in the autumn pass
the examinations she was now missing. So,
during these idle days, she spent the greater
part of her time with Margaret. Since their
long Bermuda weeks together, they had grown
into even closer intimacy, and sisters could not
have loved each other with deeper devotion.</p>

<p>Leaning on her crutches, Margaret idly
plucked the dead leaves from a geranium in
the window-box, and Corinne stood twisting
one of the younger girl's dark curls around
her finger. Presently she said:</p>

<p>"Father had a letter from old Mrs. Jewell
this morning. She says words would be impossible
to describe how happy she is. She
thinks it just marvelous that we girls were led
to do what we did, for she was in desperate
straits when we first came. She declares she
would never have accepted it as a charity, but
it was really help from her own dead kindred
sent through us. She considers it an absolute
<i>miracle</i>!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it strange!" began Margaret.
"That's the exact word Mother used last
night when we were talking it over. She said
it all seemed like a miracle to her&mdash;the way
you came into our lives, and walked straight
to the heart of the mystery that very first day;
the way we worked it all out and restored what
was her own to Alison's granddaughter just
in the nick of time; and best of all, what's happened
to me!"</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't left out in the miracle
way, either," laughed Corinne; "for I've had
the loveliest adventure imaginable, and made
the very dearest friend of all my life!" She
squeezed Margaret's hand, and the two girls
looked for one long, understanding moment
into each other's eyes. After a quiet interval
Corinne spoke again:</p>

<p>"Margaret, there's something I never told
you! No one but Father knows it. But I'm
going to tell you now. Do you know what I
plan to be when I am older?"</p>

<p>Margaret looked up at her in quick interest,
and said: "No! Tell me!"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it's my ambition to be a writer.
Father says I have some gift in that direction,
and I am constantly practising at it. But,
after I've learned how and can really write
what people might like to read, the first story
I'm going to tell is the one about Alison Trenham
and the wonderful way she helped to rescue
Washington at the time he was in such
danger!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's perfectly splendid!" cried Margaret.
"I wish I could do something like that,
but I'm afraid it isn't in me. Shall I tell you
<i>my</i> chief ambition, Corinne? I want to get
so strong that I can join a basket-ball team&mdash;and
beat the twins at it!"</p>

<p>"Bless your heart, Honey!" exclaimed Corinne,
"you're going to be the <i>captain</i> of that
team, I'll be willing to wager!"</p>

<p>Just at that moment Alexander came swinging
down the street on his way home to luncheon,
whistling the tune that had come to be
such a momentous one in their lives. Margaret
smiled as she heard it, and suddenly
turned to her friend:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>"Corinne, I want you to promise me something!
When you come to write the story of
Alison, I want you to call it 'The Lass of
Richmond Hill'! I think that would be the
most appropriate title for it. Will you?"</p>

<p>Corinne thought it over a moment, then
she said, slowly: "Yes, I think you 're right!
I promise to call it&mdash;'The Lass of Richmond
Hill'!"</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
